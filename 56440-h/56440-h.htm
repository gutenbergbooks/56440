<div class="p2 fs90 lht">
<p>The Translator of the Work which is here offered to the
Public, feels it quite unnecessary to expatiate upon the merits
of its Author, whose ideas and classifications in Physiology are
now very generally adopted. He has supposed, however, that
the experiments which constitute the <em>Second</em> Part of the Work,
are not so familiar to Professional Men, as many of the conclusions
which have been deduced from them, and therefore has
presumed that a greater publicity of these experiments will
by no means be unserviceable. Dr. Kentish, in his account
of Baths, has mentioned the circumstances which led to this
translation.</p>

<h2 class="fs120">ADVERTISEMENT BY THE FRENCH EDITOR.</h2>

<hr class="r6a3" />
<hr class="r6a" />

<p class="p2" />
<p>The work of Bichat, which appears to the most
advantage, is the one that we now reprint; his observing
mind, his experimental genius and his lucid manner of
exhibiting facts are particularly observable in it. This
work will have for a very long time a great influence on
physiologists and physicians.</p>

<p>The Physiological Researches on Life and Death have
had more than one class of admirers. Exact minds, friends
of the progress of science have praised it for the great
number of accurate observations which it contains, the
ingenious management of the experiments and the correctness
of the deductions; but they have regretted that the
author constantly placed life in opposition to physical laws,
as if living beings were not bodies before they were vegetables
or animals. They have seen with regret that he
offered illusory explanations of inexplicable phenomena.</p>

<p>These grounds of legitimate criticism seem to have
been the reason of the enthusiasm of another class of
readers, for whom whatever is vague appears to have a
great degree of attraction. The readers, of whom I have
just spoken, feeling but little interest in the new facts
which the Physiological Researches contain, have adopted
without examination its fallacious hypotheses, and attaching
to them an importance which the author never did,
because they believed that they elucidated the mechanism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_vi" id="Page_vi">[vi]</a></span>
of the most obscure vital operations, and conducted to a
true theory of medicine. Should we lament this errour?
Certainly not, as it has powerfully contributed to the
brilliant success of Bichat’s work, and by means of some
errours, much truth has been promulgated.</p>

<p>As the works of Bichat have now become classics and
their reputation cannot be increased, it is time to place
young students on their guard against the errours into
which the imagination of the author led him, and which
are the more to be feared, as Bichat in order to convince,
has employed all the fascinations of his animated style.</p>

<p>The memory of Bichat cannot but gain by it; the
numerous truths which he has discovered will shine with
a brighter light, when freed from the light shades that
envelope them.</p>

<p>Such is the object of the notes to the present edition,
which we have endeavoured to bring up to the present
state of knowledge.</p>

<span class="lht2 fs70">GENERAL DIVISION OF LIFE.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></span></h3>


<p>The definition of life is usually sought for in abstract
considerations; it will be found, if I mistake not, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
following general expression:&mdash;Life consists in the sum
of the functions, by which death is resisted.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>In living bodies, such in fact is the mode of existence,
that whatever surrounds them, tends to their destruction.
They are influenced incessantly by inorganic bodies; they
exercise themselves, the one upon the other, as constant
an action; under such circumstances they could not long
subsist, were they not possessed in themselves of a permanent
principle of reaction. This principle is that of life;
unknown in its nature, it can be only appreciated by its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
phenomena: an habitual alternation of action and reaction
between exterior bodies, and the living body, an alternation,
of which the proportions vary according to the age
of the latter, is the most general of these phenomena.</p>

<p>There is a superabundance of life in the child: In the
child, the reaction of the system is superior to the action,
which is made upon it from without. In the adult,
action and reaction are on a balance; the turgescence of
life is gone. In the old man, the reaction of the inward
principle is lessened, the action from without remaining
unaltered; it is then that life languishes, and insensibly
advances towards its natural term, which ensues when all
proportion ceases.</p>

<p>The measure, then, of life in general, is the difference
which exists between the effort of exterior power, and
that of interior resistance. The excess of the former is
an indication of its weakness; the predominance of the
latter an index of its force.</p>


<h4>I. <em>Division of Life into Animal and Organic Life.</em><a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></h4>

<p>Such is life considered in the aggregate; examined
more in detail it offers us two remarkable modifications,
the one common to the vegetable and the animal; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
other belonging exclusively to the latter. In comparing
two individuals from each of the living kingdoms, the
one will be seen existing only within itself, having with
what surrounds it the relations only of nutrition, attached
to the soil, in which its seed has been implanted, born
there, growing there, and perishing there. The other
will be observed combining with this interior life, which
in the highest degree it enjoys, an exterior life by which
it acquires a very numerous series of relations with all
surrounding bodies, a life, which couples it to the existence
of every other being, by which it is approximated,
or removed from the objects of its desires or its fears,
and seems in appropriating every thing in nature to itself,
to consider every thing with regard to its individual
existence only.<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span></p>
<p>Thus it might be said, that the vegetable is only the
sketch, or rather the ground-work of the animal; that
for the formation of the latter, it has only been requisite
to clothe the former with an apparatus of external organs,
by which it might be connected with external objects.</p>

<p>From hence it follows, that the functions of the animal
are of two very different classes. By the one (which is
composed of an habitual succession of assimilation and
excretion) it lives within itself, transforms into its
proper substance the particles of other bodies, and afterwards
rejects them when they are become heterogeneous
to its nature. By the other, it lives externally,
is the inhabitant of the world, and not as the vegetable
of a spot only; it feels, it perceives, it reflects on its
sensations, it moves according to their influence, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
frequently is enabled to communicate by its voice its
desires, and its fears, its pleasures, and its pains.</p>

<p>The aggregate of the functions of the first order, I
shall name the organic life, because all organized beings,
whether animal or vegetable, enjoy it more or less,
because organic texture is the sole condition necessary to
its existence. The sum of the functions of the second
class, because it is exclusively the property of the animal,
I shall denominate the animal life.</p>

<p>The series of the phenomena of these two lives, relate
to the individual. Generation, as a function, regards the
species, and thus has no place among them. Its connections
with the greater number of the other functions are
but very indirect; it commences a long time after them,
it is extinct a long time before them. In the greater
number of animals the periods of its activity are separated
by long intervals of time, and during these, it is absolutely
null. Even in man, with whom the remissions of
its impulses, are much less durable, it has not a much
more extensive connexion with the rest of the system.
Castration is almost always marked by a general increase
of the nutritive process; the eunuch, enjoying indeed a
less degree of vital energy, but the phenomena of his
life being displayed with a greater exuberance. We
shall here, then, lay aside the consideration of the laws
which give us existence, and occupy ourselves alone on
those which maintain us in existence. Of the former we
shall speak hereafter.</p>


<h4>II. <em>Subdivision of each of the two lives into two
orders of functions.</em></h4>

<p>The animal and the organic life, are each of them
composed of two orders of functions, which succeed each
other, and are concatenated in an inverse direction.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span></p>

<p>In the animal life, the first order is established from
the exterior of the body, towards the brain; the second
from the brain towards the organs of locomotion and
the voice. The impression of objects successively affects
the senses, the nerves and the brain. The first receive,
the second transmit, the third perceives the impression.
The impression, in such way, received, transmitted, and
perceived, constitutes sensation.</p>

<p>The animal, in the first order of these functions, is
almost passive; in the second, he becomes active.&mdash;This
second order is the result of the successive actions of the
brain (where volition has been produced in consequence
of the previous sensation) of the nerves, which transmit
such volition, and of the locomotive organs and voice,
which are the agents of volition. External bodies act
upon the animal by means of the first order of these
functions, the animal reacts upon them by means of the
second.</p>

<p>In general there exists between the two orders a
rigorous proportion; where the one is very marked, the
other is put forth with energy. In the series of living
beings, the animal, which feels the most, moves also
the most. The age of lively perception, is that also of
vivacity of motion; in sleep, where the first order is
suspended, the second ceases, or is exercised only with
irregularity. The blind man, who is but half alive to
what surrounds him, moves also with a tardiness which
would very soon be lost, where his exterior communications
to be enlarged.</p>

<p>A double movement is also exercised in the organic
life; the one composes, the other decomposes the animal.
Such is the mode of existence in the living body, that
what it was at one time it ceases to be at another. Its
organization remains unaltered, but its elements vary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
every moment. The molecules of its nutrition by turns
absorbed and rejected, from the animal pass to the plant,
from the plant to inorganic matter, return to the animal,
and so proceed in an endless revolution.</p>

<p>To such revolution the organic life is well adapted.
One order of its functions assimilates to the animal the
substances which are destined to nourish him; another
order deprives him of these substances, when, after
having for some time made a part of it, they are become
heterogeneous to his organization.</p>

<p>The first, which is that of assimilation, results from
the functions of digestion, circulation, respiration, and
nutrition. Every particle, which is foreign to the body
before it becomes an element of it, is subject to the
influence of these four functions.</p>

<p>When it has afterwards concurred for some time to the
formation of the organs, the absorbents seize on it, and
throw it out into the circulatory torrent, where it is
carried on anew, and from whence it issues by the
pulmonary or cutaneous exhalations, or by the different
secretions by which the fluids are ejected from the body.</p>

<p>The second order, then, of the functions of the organic
life, or that of decomposition, is formed of those of absorption,
circulation, exhalation, and secretion.</p>

<p>The sanguiferous system, in consequence, is a middle
system, the centre of the organic life, as the brain is the
centre of the animal life. In this system the particles,
which are about to be assimilated, are circulated and intermixed
with those, which having been already assimilated,
are destined to be rejected; so that the blood itself is a
fluid composed of two parts; the one, the pabulum of all
the parts of the body, and derived from the aliment;
the other, excrementitious, composed of the wrecks and
residue of the organs, and the source of the exterior<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
secretions and exhalations.&mdash;Nevertheless these latter
functions serve also, at times, the purpose of transmitting
without the body, the products of digestion, although
such products may not have concurred to the nourishments
of the parts. This circumstance may be observed
when urine and sweat are secreted after copious drinking.
The skin and the kidneys being at such times the excreting
organs, not of the matter of the nutritive, but of that
of the digestive process; the same also may be said of
the milk of animals, for this is a fluid which certainly has
never been assimilated.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a></p>

<p>There does not exist between the two orders of the
functions of the organic life the same relation, which
takes place between those of the animal life. The
weakness of the first by no means renders absolutely
necessary a decrease of action in the second. Hence
proceed marasmus and leanness, states, in which the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
assimilating process ceases in part, the process of excretion
remaining unaltered.</p>

<p>Let us leave, then, to other sciences, all artificial
method, but follow the concatenation of the phenomena
of life, for connecting the ideas which we form of them,
and we shall perceive, that the greater part of the present
physiological divisions, afford us but uncertain bases for
the support of any thing like a solid edifice of science.</p>

<p>These divisions I shall not recapitulate; the best
method of demonstrating their inutility will be, if I
mistake not, to prove the solidity of the division, which
I have adopted. We shall now examine the great differences,
which separate the animal existing without, from
the animal existing within, and wearing itself away in a
continual vicissitude of assimilation and excretion.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_1_1" id="Footnote_1_1"></a><a href="#FNanchor_1_1"><span class="label">[1]</span></a> The form adopted by Bichat, in this work, has been much blamed
by some, and extravagantly praised by others. The blame and the
praise appear to me to be equally misplaced. His object was to exhibit
the various phenomena of life; the order in which this was to be done
was a matter of indifference. If Bichat gave a preference to this form,
it was because it was conformable to the nature of his mind; and he
accomplished his task in a very happy manner. The division that
he has adopted is not new, it may be found, with slight modifications,
in writers of different periods, and even in Aristotle. Besides, it is not
necessary in the sciences to attach a very great importance to classification.
All these contrivances have been invented only to aid the
memory; and the functions of living bodies are not so numerous, as to
render it necessary in studying them to lean upon systematic divisions.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_2_2" id="Footnote_2_2"></a><a href="#FNanchor_2_2"><span class="label">[2]</span></a> The word <em>life</em> has been employed by physiologists in two different
senses. With some, it means an imaginary being, the sole principle of
all the functions which living bodies exhibit; with others, it means
only the assemblage of these functions. It is in this last sense that
Bichat employs it. This is what he means to say in the following
sentence. <em>Life is the assemblage of the functions which resist death.</em>
He is wrong only in allowing the idea of death to enter into it; for this
idea necessarily supposes that of life. There is then really a bad circle
in this definition; but in putting aside what is defective in the expression,
it may be seen that Bichat considers life as a result, not as a cause.
</p>
<p>
Before and since the time of Bichat, a great number of definitions of
life has been given, which are either false or incomplete. It should not
be required of a definition, that it should give all the properties of the
thing which it is designed to make known, this would be a description;
but we have a right to expect that it should assign to this thing certain
characters which belong to it alone, and thus distinguish it from every
thing else.
</p>
<p>
Let us examine by this principle the definition adopted in a modern
work. <em>Life</em>, it is said, <em>is the assemblage of the phenomena which
succeed each other, for a limited time, in an organized being</em>. This is
no doubt true of life; but, if it can also be applied to another state,
it ceases to be a definition. An animal has just died; its organs from
that moment are subject to the action of chemical affinities only;
decomposition takes place, gases are disengaged, fluids flow out and
new solid aggregates are formed. After a time every molecular motion
ceases; there remains only a certain number of binary, ternary combinations,
&amp;c. Here then is an <em>assemblage of phenomena taking place for
a limited time in an organized body</em>, and yet it is not life.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_3_3" id="Footnote_3_3"></a><a href="#FNanchor_3_3"><span class="label">[3]</span></a> This distinction of the two lives is bad, inasmuch as it tends to
separate phenomena which have a very intimate connexion, which
relate to a common object, and which are often produced by means in
every respect similar. Why should I rank among the organs of animal
life the muscular apparatus which carries the alimentary mass from the
mouth into the oesophagus, and among those of the other life, that
which takes it from the cardiac orifice to the anus? Is not the action
of the first apparatus in relation with nutrition as well as the action of
the last, and does not the muscular apparatus of the oesophagus act
upon a body which is foreign to us, as well as that of the tongue and the
pharynx? Do the motions of mastication differ in their object from
those of which we have just spoken, and as to the means of execution,
does not the muscular action still perform the principal part?
</p>
<p>
We might in the same way bring near each other the motions by
means of which we seize our food. The action itself of the senses,
which directs these motions, is, with nutrition, in a relation more
remote, but not less necessary, and we see in the various classes of
animals that their apparatus is modified according to the different kinds
of nourishment. If the distinction of the two lives be wanting in
justice, as to the object of the functions it separates, we shall soon see
that the characters attached to the organs of one and the other do not
establish this division in a more striking manner.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> This division between vegetables and animals is far from being so
striking as is here supposed; these two classes of beings, so different
when we examine them in the individuals endowed with a very complicated
organization, approximate each other in a remarkable degree,
when we descend to those species whose structure is most simple; it is
even remarkable that the most constant character which distinguishes
one from the other, is not found in the organs of animal life, but in those
of vegetable or organic life. The senses are one after the other found
wanting; for in an individual in whom we can discover no nervous
system, there is no more reason to suppose the existence of the sense
of touch as a sensation, than to suppose it in the sensitive plant, the
dionæa muscipula, and other similar plants; we see only action and
reaction. The motions of the arms of certain polypi no more suppose
volition than the motion of the root which follows a wet sponge, or that
of the branches which turn towards the light; the only very constant
character is the absence or presence of a digestive cavity. To speak
of an animal as a vegetable clothed with an external apparatus of organs
of relation, is a more brilliant than profound view of the subject.
Buisson, who, in his division of the physiological phenomena, avoids this
inaccuracy, has himself fallen into error; he pretends that respiration
belongs exclusively to animals; and that thus the division of Bichat
was not only unfounded but also incomplete, since this function, which
is neither of vegetation nor of relation, could be ranked under neither
life. Buisson was not well informed; no doubt the respiration of
vegetables does not exhibit the most apparent phenomena of the
respiration of the mammalia, but every thing, which essentially constitutes
the function, is found in the one as well as in the other;
absorption of the atmospheric air, and the formation and exhalation of
a new gas; the rest is only accidental and is not an appendage but in
certain classes of animals. In some reptiles, though we find a particular
organ for respiration, this organ is not indispensable; it may be removed,
and the skin becomes the only respiratory organ; and when finally we
come to consider animals with <em>tracheæ</em>, we see that the conformity
becomes more and more evident.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> Bichat seems here to adopt the generally received opinion that it is
the chyle which furnishes to the mammary gland the materials of which
the milk is composed. We know not whence this opinion arises, if it
be not from the gross resemblance which the chyle and milk often
exhibit. This resemblance, if it were very great, would be a poor
reason for admitting, without anatomical proof, so singular a fact; but
it is very far from being perfect. The chyle in fact does not exhibit
the milky appearance and the white opaque colour, only when the
animal from whom it is taken, has fed upon substances containing fat;
in all other cases, it is almost transparent; its odour and taste, under
all circumstances, differ entirely from those of milk; if these two fluids
are left to themselves, the milk remains a long time without coagulating,
but the chyle almost immediately coagulates, and then separates into
three parts. The solid portion soon exhibits cells, and an appearance
of organization; nothing similar is seen in the coagulum of milk; the
serum of the milk remains colourless when exposed to the simple
contact of the air, that of the chyle assumes a rosy tint, often very
vivid. Finally, if we examine the chemical composition of these two
fluids, we shall find in them differences still more striking. (See for
farther details, my Elements of Physiology, Vol. 2d.)</p></div></div>

<br />
<span class="fs50">GENERAL DIFFERENCES OF THE TWO LIVES WITH REGARD
TO THE OUTWARD FORM OF THEIR RESPECTIVE ORGANS.</span></h3>


<p>The organs of the animal life are symmetrical, those
of the organic life irregular in their conformation; in
this circumstance consists the most essential of their
differences. Such character, however, to some animals,
and among the fish, to the sole and turbot especially, is
not applicable; but in man it is exactly traced, as well as
in all the genera which are nearest to him in perfection.
In them alone am I about to examine it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span></p>


<h4>I. <em>Symmetry of the external forms of the animal life.</em><a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a></h4>

<p>Two globes in every respect the same, receive the
impressions of light. Sounds and odours, have also their
double analogous organ. A single membrane is affected
to savours, but the median line is manifest upon it, and
the two segments, which are indicated by it, are exactly
similar. This line indeed is not every where to be seen
in the skin, but it is every where implied. Nature, as it
were, has forgotten to describe it, but from space to space
she has laid down a number of points, which mark its
passage. The cleft at the extremity of the nose, of the
chin, and the middle of the lips, the umbilicus, the seam
of the perineum, the projection of the spinous apophyses
of the back, and the hollow at the posterior part of the
neck are the principal points at which it is shewn.</p>

<p>The Nerves, which transmit the impressions received
by the senses, are evidently assembled in symmetrical
pairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<p>The brain, the organ (on which the impressions of
objects are received) is remarkable also for the regularity
of its form. Its double parts are exactly alike, and even
those which are single, are all of them symmetrically
divided by the median line.</p>

<p>The Nerves again, which transmit to the agents of
locomotion and of the voice, the volitions of the brain,
the locomotive organs also, which are formed in a great
degree of the muscular system, of the bony system, and
its dependencies, these together with the larynx and its
accessories, composing the double agents of volition,
have all of them a regularity, a symmetry, which are
invariable.</p>

<p>Such even is the truth of the character which I am now
describing, that the muscles and the nerves immediately
cease to be regular, as soon as they cease to appertain to
the animal life. The heart, and the muscular fibres of
the intestines are proofs of this assertion in the muscles;
in the nerves, the great sympathetic, is an evidence of its
truth.</p>

<p>We may conclude then from simple inspection, that
Symmetry is the essential character of the organs of the
animal life of man.</p>


<h4>II. <em>Irregularity of the exterior forms of the organic
life.</em></h4>

<p>If at present we pass to the viscera of the organic life,
we shall perceive a character directly the contrary of the
former. The stomach, the intestines, the spleen, the
liver, &amp;c. are all of them irregularly disposed.</p>

<p>In the system of the circulation, the heart and the large
vessels, such as the upper divisions of the aorta, the vena
azygos, the vena portæ, and the arteria innominata have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
no one trace of symmetry. In the vessels of the extremities
continual varieties are also observed, and when they
occur, it is particularly remarkable that their existence
on one side in no way affects the other side of the body.</p>

<p>The apparatus of respiration appears indeed at first to be
exactly regular; nevertheless, the bronchi are dissimilar
in length, diameter, and direction; three lobes compose
one of the lungs, two the other: between these organs
also, there is a manifest difference of volume; the two
divisions of the pulmonary artery resemble each other
neither in their course, nor in their diameter; and the
mediastinum is sensibly directed to the left. We shall
thus perceive that symmetry is here apparent only, and
that the common law has no exception.</p>

<p>The organs of exhalation and absorption, the serous
membranes, the thoracic duct, the great right lymphatic
vessel, and the secondary absorbents of all the parts have
a distribution universally unequal and irregular.</p>

<p>In the glandular system also we see the crypts, or
mucous follicles disseminated in a disorderly manner in
every part; the pancreas, the liver, the salivary glands
themselves, though at first sight more symmetrical, are
not exactly submitted to the median line; added to this,
the kidneys differ from each other in their situation, in
the length and size of their artery and vein, and in their
frequent varieties more especially.<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span></p>

<p>From considerations so numerous we are led to a result
exactly the reverse of the preceding one; namely, that
the especial attribute of the organs of the interior life is
irregularity of exterior form.</p>


<h4>III. <em>Consequences resulting from the difference of
exterior form in the organs of the two lives.</em></h4>

<p>It follows from the preceding description, that the
animal life is as it were double; that its phenomena
performed as they are at the same time on the two sides
of the body, compose a system in each of them independent
of the opposite system; that there is a life to
the right, a life to the left; that the one may exist, the
other ceasing to do so, and that they are doubtless
intended reciprocally to supply the place of each other.</p>

<p>The latter circumstance we may frequently observe in
those morbid affections so common, where the animal
sensibility and mobility are enfeebled, or annihilated on
one side of the body, and capable of no affection whatever;
where the man on one side is little more than the
vegetable, while on the other he preserves his claim to
the animal character. Undoubtedly those partial palsies,
in which the median line, is the limit where the faculties
of sensation and motion finish, and the origin from
whence they begin can never be remarked so invariably
in animals, which, like the oyster, have an irregular
exterior.</p>

<p>On the contrary the organic life is a single system, in
which every thing is connected and concatenated; where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
the functions on one side cannot be interrupted, and those
on the other subsist. A diseased liver influences the state
of the stomach; if the colon on one side cease to act, that
upon the other side cannot continue in action: the same
attack, which arrests the circulation in the right side of
the heart, will annihilate it also in the left side of the
heart. Hence it follows, the internal organs on one side
being supposed to suspend their functions, that those on
the other must remain inactive, and death ensue.</p>

<p>This assertion, however, is a general one; it is only
applicable to the sum of the organic life, and not to its
isolated phenomena. Some of them in fact are double,
and their place may be supplied&mdash;the kidneys and lungs
are of this description.</p>

<p>I shall not enquire into the cause of this remarkable
difference, which in man, and those animals which
approach him the nearest, distinguishes the organs of the
two lives. I shall only observe, that it enters essentially
into the nature of their phenomena, and that the perfection
of the animal functions is so connected with the
general symmetry observed in their respective organs,
that every thing which troubles such symmetry, will
more or less impair the functions.</p>

<p>It is from thence, no doubt, that proceeds this other
difference of the two lives, namely, that nature very
rarely varies the usual conformation of the organs of the
animal life. Grimaud has made this observation, but has
not shewn the principle on which it depends.</p>

<p>It is a fact, which cannot have escaped any one the
least accustomed to dissection, that the spleen, the liver,
the stomach, the kidneys, the salivary glands, and others
of the internal life, are frequently various in form, size,
position, and direction. Such in the vascular system are
these varieties, that scarcely will any two subjects be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
found exactly alike under the scalpel of the anatomist:
the organs of absorption, the lymphatic glands in particular,
are rarely the same either in number or volume,
neither do the mucous glands in any way affect a fixed
and analogous situation.</p>

<p>And not only is each particular system subject to
frequent aberrations, but the whole of the organs of
the internal life are sometimes found in the inverse
of the natural order. Of this I have lately seen an
instance.</p>

<p>Let us now consider the organs of the animal life, the
senses, the brain, the voluntary muscles, and the larynx:
here every thing is exact, precise, and rigourously determined.
In these there is scarcely ever seen a variety of
conformation; if there do exist any, the functions are
troubled, disturbed, or destroyed: they remain unaltered
in the organic life, whatever may be the disposition of
the parts.</p>

<p>The difference with respect to action, in the organs of
the two lives, depends, undoubtedly, upon the symmetry
of the one, whose functions the least change of conformation
would have disturbed, and on the irregularity of
the other, with which these different changes very well
agree.</p>

<p>The functions of every organ of the animal life are
immediately connected with the resemblance of the organ
to its fellow on the opposite side if double, or if single to
its similarity of conformation in its two halves: from
hence the influence of organic changes upon the derangement
of the functions may be well conceived.</p>

<p>But this assertion will become more sensible, when I
shall have pointed out the relations which exist between
the symmetry and the irregularity of the organs, and the
harmony and the discordance of their functions.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> It is rather to the external forms that symmetry appears to have
been primitively attached, and it is in some measure accidentally and
because the nature of their functions requires in general that they
should be placed on the exterior, that the organs of relation are found
modified in virtue of this law. In the example cited, of fishes without
a bladder, the eyes, to lose nothing of their utility, must be differently
placed, and on the face, which alone is in relation with the light; yet
even in this case, the symmetry of external forms has been displaced
rather than destroyed, and at the first examination it seems complete.
When the organs of relation are found placed on the interior, they
frequently exhibit some irregularity, and to take an example of a known
animal, the organ of voice, in the male duck, is a very remarkable one;
in man even, the wind-pipe is not symmetrical, after it arrives at the first
division of the bronchia. On the contrary, among the organs of the
other life, those which are prominent on the exterior, constantly
present the symmetrical character, as the thyroid gland; the mammary

also to the brain, the two lobes of which never exhibit the same

<br />
<span class="fs50">GENERAL DIFFERENCE OF THE TWO LIVES WITH REGARD
TO THE MODE OF ACTION OF THEIR
RESPECTIVE ORGANS.</span></h3>


<p>Harmony is to the functions of the organs, what symmetry
is to their conformation; it supposes a perfect
equality of force and action, between their similar parts,
just as symmetry indicates an exact analogy of external
form, and internal structure: indeed it is a necessary
consequence of symmetry, for two parts essentially alike
in structure, cannot much differ in their manner of action.
Hence we should be naturally led to the following conclusion,
namely, that harmony is the character of the
animal, discordance that of the organic functions. But
on these points we must be more particular.</p>


<h4>I. <em>Of harmony of action in the animal life.</em></h4>

<p>We have already observed, that the animal life arises
from the successive actions of the senses, the nerves, the
brain, the locomotive organs, and the voice. We shall
now consider what harmony of action is, in each of these
great divisions.</p>

<p>The precision of our sensations appears to be the more
complete in proportion as there exists a resemblance
between the two impressions, of which they are each of
them the assemblage. We see inaccurately when one
of the eyes is better formed, and stronger than the other;
when it conveys to the brain a clearer image than its
fellow does. It is to avoid this confusion that we shut
one eye, while the action of the other is increased by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
application of a lens, for at such time there can be no
harmony of action in the two organs; accordingly, we
make use of one of them only in order to avoid the discordance
of the impression.&mdash;What a lens applied to one
eye only produces artificially, is exemplified in a natural
way by squinting.&mdash;We squint, says Buffon, because
we turn the weaker eye from the object on which the
stronger is fixed; for in so doing we avoid the confusion,
which would arise from the perception of two dissimilar
images.</p>

<p>We know that many other causes may contribute to
the production of this effect, but we cannot doubt the
reality of the reason assigned. We know also, that in
some animals each eye may act without the assistance of
the other, and that two different objects may be transmitted
at the same time by the two eyes of certain other
animals; but this circumstance, when the action of both
the organs is united upon a single object, should by no
means prevent a similarity in the two impressions. A
single sensation is the consequence of the combination;
but in what way can such sensation be formed with
accuracy, if the same body at the same time be pictured
both in strong and weak colours on the one and the other
of the retinæ?</p>

<p>What we have said of the eye may be equally well
applied to the ear. If, of the two sensations which form
a sound, the one be received by a strong and well formed
organ, the other by a weak one, the impressions will be
unequal; the brain also, because it is differently affected
by each, will be the seat of an imperfect perception.
Such conformation constitutes what is called an incorrect
or false ear. For what reason does it happen that one
man is unpleasantly affected by a dissonance, while
another does not even perceive it? The reason is this,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
that in the one, the two perceptions of the same sound
are identical; in the other, dissimilar.<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> For the same
reason a man with a correct ear will combine his dancing
with the cadence of the measure given him; another
without this similarity of organ will be as constantly at
variance in his motions with the orchestra.</p>

<p>Buffon has confined his observations on harmony of
action, to the organs of vision and hearing; we shall
push our examination of it farther.</p>

<p>In the sense of smelling, as well as in the other senses,
we must admit of two impressions; the one primitive,
and belonging to the organ, the other consecutive, and
affecting the sensorium: now the latter may vary, the
former remaining unaltered. Many odours are disagreeable
to some, but pleasant to others; and this, not because
there is any difference in the affection of the pituitary
membrane, but because in different individuals, the mind
may attach a very different sentiment to the same impression.&mdash;Hence
a variety of results does not in this case
suppose a difference of principle.</p>

<p>But sometimes the impression which is made upon the
pituitary membrane does really differ from that which it
ought to be, for producing perfect sensation. Two dogs
pursue the same game; the one never loses scent, but
makes the same turnings and windings with the animal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
before him; the other follows his game also, but often
stops and hesitates, endeavors to recover the scent, proceeds
and stops again. The first of these receives a
lively impression of the scented emanation; the organs
of the second are only confusedly affected. Now it may
be asked whether this confusion does not arise from the
unequal action of the two nostrils, from the superior
organization of the one, and from the imperfection of the
other?&mdash;the following observations appear to decide the
question.</p>

<p>In the coryza, which affects but one of the nostrils, if
the two be suffered to remain open, the sense of smelling
is confused; but let the diseased nostril be shut, and the
smell shall immediately become distinct. A polypus in
one of the nostrils debilitates the action of the pituitary
membrane on the affected side, the other remaining in its
healthy state: hence, as in the preceding case, ensues a
want of harmony in the two organs, and the same confusion
in the perception of odours. The greater number
of the affections of a single nostril have similar effects,
which may be all of them corrected by the same means.
And wherefore? because in rendering one of the pituitary
membranes inactive, we put a stop to the discordance
which is occasioned by the deficiency of action in the
other. From the above facts (since any accidental cause,
which destroys the harmony of action in these organs,
is capable of rendering the perception of odours inexact)
we may conclude, that when the perception is naturally
inaccurate, there is a natural dissimilarity in the formation
of the organs, and therefore a difference of power in
them.</p>

<p>The same reasoning may be applied to the sense of
taste. It is often the case that one side of the tongue is
affected by palsy or spasm, the median line dividing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
insensible half from the other, which continues to preserve
its sensibility. But such affection may take place
in a variety of degrees, and one side of the tongue retain
a power of perceiving savours though in a less perfection
than the other side. In such case it is natural to
suppose that the taste must be confused; because a clear
perception cannot be the consequence of two unequal
sensations.</p>

<p>The perfection of the touch as well as that of the other
senses, is essentially connected with uniformity of action
in the two symmetrical halves of the body, and particularly
in the hands. Let us suppose, for instance, a man
born blind, to have one hand well organized, the other
defective in the power of moving the thumb and fingers,
and forming only a stiff and immovable surface; such
person would find it a very difficult thing to acquire a
just notion of the size and figure of bodies, because the
same sensation would not arise from the successive application
of each hand to the same substance. Let both
of his hands, for example, be supposed to touch a small
sphere; the one by the extremities of the fingers will
embrace it in all its diameters, and convey to him the
idea of roundness; the other, which will be in contact
with it only in a few points, will produce a very different
sensation. Embarrassed between these two bases of his
judgment, he will scarcely be able to decide, nay, it is
even possible that he may form a double judgment from
the double sensation which is presented him: his ideas
would be more correct were he to use only the perfect
hand, in the same manner as the person who squints,
makes use of the perfect eye only. Our hands then assist
each other reciprocally; the one confirms the notions
which are given us by the other; hence the necessary
uniformity of their conformation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>The hands are not the only instruments of the sense
of touch. The axilla, the groin, the concavity of the
foot and many other parts, may all of them from their
application to bodies, afford us so many bases for our
judgments with regard to external form. Now, if one
half of the body were differently arranged from the other
half, the same uncertainty in perception would infallibly
be the result. From all that has been said, we may
conclude, that in the external organs of sense, a harmony
of action in the two symmetrical parts, or the two similar
halves of the organ, is a condition essential to the perfection
of sensation.</p>

<p>The external senses are the natural excitants of the
brain. The functions of the brain succeed to theirs, and
this organ would but languish, were it not to find in them
the principle of its activity. From sensation follow
perception, memory and imagination; from these the
judgment. Now it is easy to prove, that these different
functions, commonly known by the name of the internal
senses,<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> are governed in their actions by the same laws,
which influence the external senses; and that like them,
they approach the nearer to perfection in proportion to
the degree of harmony existing in the symmetrical parts,
in which they have their seat.</p>

<p>Let us suppose for instance one hemisphere of the
brain to be better organised, and therefore susceptible of
livelier affections than its fellow; in such case the perception
of the individual would be confused, for the brain
is to the soul what the senses are to the brain; it transmits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
to the soul the impressions conveyed to it by the senses,
as the senses convey to the brain the impressions made
upon them by external objects. But, if the defect of
harmony in the external senses confuse the perception of
the brain, why may not the soul perceive but confusedly,
when the two hemispheres of the brain are unequal in
power, and incapable of blending into one the double
impression, which is made upon them?</p>

<p>The memory is the faculty of re-producing former
sensations, the imagination that of creating new ones,
now in the act of remembering or imagining, each hemisphere
of the brain appears to re-produce, or to create
a sensation of its own. If both do not act alike, the
perception of the mind, which ought to be the result of
the two sensations united, will be inexact and irregular.
But, it is evident, that there will be a disparity in the
two sensations, if there be a disparity in the two halves
of the brain, in which they have arisen, and since the
general foundations of the judgment are made up of the
faculties of perception, memory, and imagination, if these
be confused, the judgment itself must be confused also.</p>

<p>We have now supposed an inequality of action in the
hemispheres of the brain, and inferred, that the functions
would in this supposition be imperfect; but what as yet
is only supposition, in a variety of instances can be
proved to be a fact; for nothing is more common than to
find in consequence of compression on either hemisphere
by blood, pus, or exostosis, a variety of alterations in the
intellectual functions.</p>

<p>Even when all appearances of actual compression have
vanished, if in consequence of that which has been
experienced, a part of the brain remain enfeebled, the
same alterations of mental power will be found to be
prolonged. If both hemispheres of the brain, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
be affected equally, the judgment though weaker, will be
more exact.<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> Perhaps it is thus, that we should explain
those observations so frequently repeated, of an accidental
stroke upon one side of the head having restored the
intellectual functions, which had long remained dormant
in consequence of a blow received upon the other side.</p>

<p>I now conceive myself to have proved, that with
inequality of action in the hemispheres, there must be
confusion of intellect. I have also pointed out some
states of disease, in which such confusion is evidently
the effect of inequality of action so occasioned; here we
see the effect and its cause; but may we not from analogy,
infer a similar cause where we see a like effect? when
the judgment is habitually incorrect, and all the ideas
wanting in precision, may we not be induced to believe,
that there does exist a defect of harmony in the action of
the two hemispheres of the brain? We see inaccurately
if nature have not given to both eyes an equal power;
we perceive and judge inaccurately in like manner, if the
two sides of the brain are naturally dissimilar. The most
correct mind, and the soundest judgment, pre-suppose in
the hemispheres a perfect harmony of action; and what
a multiplicity of shades do we not behold in the operations
of the understanding? it is probable that they all of
them correspond to so many varieties in the proportions
of power in the hemispheres. Could we squint with the
brain as we do with the eyes&mdash;that is to say, could we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
receive impressions on one hemisphere only, and form
from thence our determinations, we might then command
at will, a precision in our intellectual operations; but
such a power does not exist.</p>

<p>To the functions of the brain succeed those of locomotion
and the voice. The first of these would appear
almost to form an exception to the general law. In
considering the two vertical halves of the body, we shall
perceive that the one is constantly more powerful than
the other with respect to the strength and number of its
movements. The right half is that, which from custom,
is most made use of.</p>

<p>To comprehend the reason of this difference; we
must make a difference between strength and agility;
strength depends upon the perfection of the organization,
on the energy of the nutritive process, on the plenitude
of life in the muscular fibre; agility, on the contrary, is
the result of habit and frequent exercise.<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span></p>

<p>At present we shall observe, that this disparity of
action in the locomotive organs, does not consist in the
difference of their actual strength, but in that of the
agility, with which these motions are executed.&mdash;All is
equal in the size, in the number of fibres, and nerves
both of the one and the other of the superior, or inferior
extremities; the difference of their vascular systems is
scarcely any thing. From hence it follows that the
discordance does not exist in nature, but that it is the
effect of our social habits, which by multiplying our
movements on one side of the body, increase their
address without much adding to their power. Such in
fact are the wants of society, as to call forth a certain
number of general movements, which must be performed
by all in the same direction, in order to be understood.
It is generally agreed, that this direction shall be from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
left to right. The letters, which form the writing of
most nations, are in this way directed; such circumstance
occasions the necessity of our using the right hand to
form them in preference to the left, the former being as
much better adapted to this method, as the latter would
be to the contrary one; of this we may convince ourselves
by experiment.</p>

<p>The direction of the letters from left to right, imposes
on us the necessity also of casting our eyes upon them
in the same direction. From this habit acquired in
reading, arises that of examining objects in the same
manner.</p>

<p>The necessity of similar movements when men are
drawn up in line of battle, has induced almost all nations
to handle their weapons with their right hands; the
harmony too which prevails in the dances of even the
most savage people exacts an accord in the limbs, which
they constantly preserve by making all their principal
movements with the right. We might add to these
examples a great variety of others.</p>

<p>The general movements agreed on by society, which,
if every one were not to execute them in the same
direction, would be creative of much confusion; these
movements, I say, by the influence of habit, oblige us for
our own particular movements to use the limbs, which
they have brought into action. Hence, the members of
the right side of the body are perpetually in action either
for our own particular wants, or for those which we feel
in conjunction with others.</p>

<p>Now, as the habitude of acting, continually tends to the
perfection of action, we may perceive the reason, why the
right side acquires a greater facility in the performance
of many motions than the left. This increased facility is
not original, but acquired.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span></p>

<p>So remarkable a difference then, in the two symmetrical
halves of the body, is not by nature meant as an exception
to the general law of harmony of action in the external
functions; for those movements, which are executed by
the whole of the body, are the more precise in proportion
to the smallness of the difference existing in the agility
of the muscles of the two sides. How happens it that
certain animals leap from rock to rock with such admirable
precision, where the least deviation from the intended
direction, would plunge them into an abyss? how happens
it that they run with such astonishing address on planes,
which are scarcely equal in breadth to the extremities of
their limbs? how happens it that the walk of the very
heaviest of animals is never attended with those false
steps so frequent in the progression of man? The reason
must be, that the difference in their locomotive organs
in both sides of the body is scarcely any thing, and that
in consequence there must be a constant harmony of action
in these organs.</p>

<p>He, whose general movements, or those of the whole
of the body are the most perfect, has the least command
in particular over those of the right side; for, as I shall
prove hereafter, the perfection of a part is never acquired
but at the expense of that of the whole. The child, who
should be taught to make an equal use of all his limbs,
would possess a precision in his general movements, which
he would find extremely difficult to acquire for those of
the right hand, such as writing or fencing.</p>

<p>I can easily suppose, that some few natural circumstances
may have exercised upon us an influence in our
choice with respect to the direction of those general
motions, which the habits of society have established.
Such may be the slight excess of diameter in the right
subclavian artery, and the sensation of lassitude during<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
digestion, which is more perceived upon the left side on
account of the situation of the stomach, and may therefore
have determined us to act at such time upon the
opposite side in preference. Such also may be the
natural instinct, by which, to express our feelings we
carry the right hand to the heart; but these circumstances
are trifling in comparison with the very great difference
of the movements which from the state of civilization
exists between the symmetrical halves of the body; and
from this view of the subject, we cannot but regard this
difference as the effect of social convention, and by no
means the intent of nature.</p>

<p>The voice, together with locomotion, is the last act of
the animal life in the natural order of its functions. Now
the greater number of physiologists, and Haller in particular,
have indicated as the causes of want of harmony in
the voice, the dissimilarity of the two portions of the
larynx, the inequality of force in the muscles, which
move the arytenoid cartilages, the same inequality of
action in the nerves, which are distributed to each half of
the organ, and the different reflection of sounds in the
nostrils and frontal sinuses. Without doubt a defective
voice must frequently depend upon a faulty ear; when
we hear incorrectly, we sing incorrectly; but when a
correct ear is united with a want of precision in the voice,
the cause is then in the larynx.</p>

<p>The most harmonious voice is that, which the two portions
of the larynx produce in an equal degree; where
the vibrations on one side correspond exactly in number,
strength and duration with those upon the opposite side.<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
In the same manner the most perfect singing will be
produced by two voices exactly similar in tone, compass,
and inflection.</p>

<p>From the numerous considerations which I have offered,
the following general conclusion may be deduced&mdash;namely,
that one of the most essential characteristics
of the animal life, is a harmony of action in the two
analogous parts, or in the two sides of the simple organ
concurring to the same end. The relation which exists
between this harmony of action, which is the character
of the functions, and symmetry of form, which is the
attribute of the organs of the animal life, will easily be
seen.</p>

<p>I wish to observe in finishing this section, that in
pointing out the different derangements, which take place
in the animal life, from the want of harmony in the
organs, I have only pretended to assign a single isolated
cause of such derangements; I am well aware that a
thousand other causes besides dissimilarity in the hemispheres
of the brain, may affect the operations of the mind.</p>


<h4>II. <em>Of discordance of action in the organic life.</em></h4>

<p>Along with the phenomena of the animal life, let us
now consider those of the organic life, and we shall find
that harmony has nothing to do with them. Of what
detriment would it be to the general health of the individual,
should one of his kidneys be stronger than the
other, and secrete more urine; should one of his lungs
be better unfolded than the other, admit more venous,
and send out more arterial blood; should a less organic
force be the lot of the salivary glands on one side than
on the other side of his body? The simple function, to
which both organs concur, would not be performed less<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
perfectly. Whenever but a slight fulness supervenes on
one side of the liver, spleen, or pancreas, the sound part
makes up for the defect, and the function is little disturbed.
The circulation also remains unaltered among the
frequent variations in the vascular system of each side
of the body, whether such variations exist naturally, or
whether they arise from some artificial obliteration of the
larger vessels as in aneurism.</p>

<p>Hence we find those numerous irregularities of structure,
those malconformations, which as I have said may
be remarked in the organic life, and nothing of a morbid
nature in consequence arising. From hence we see that
almost continual succession of modifications, which lessen
or increase the circle of the organic functions. The vital
powers, and their exciting causes, are continually varying,
and thus occasion a constant instability in the functions
of the organs, for a thousand causes may at every moment
double or triple the activity of the circulation, and respiration,
increase or diminish the quantity of bile, urine, or
saliva, and suspend or augment the nutrition of the parts.
Hunger, food, sleep, motion, rest, and the passions may all
of them impress upon these functions so great a mobility,
as every day to make them run through a hundred degrees
of strength or weakness.</p>

<p>In the animal life on the contrary, every thing is
uniform and constant, the powers of the senses cannot
experience these alternate modifications, or at least, not
in so marked a manner. Indeed they are at all times in a
state of relation with the physical powers, which preside
over exterior bodies; now the latter remaining unaltered,
such variations would destroy all relative connexion, and
thus the functions cease.</p>

<p>Besides, if this mobility, which characterises the organic
life, were the attribute of sensation&mdash;for the same reason<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
it would be that of all the operations of the mind. In
such case of what would man consist? The perpetual
sport of every thing surrounding him, he would find his
existence at one time little different from that of inanimate
matter, at others superior in perfection and energy to that
even which he now enjoys, allied at one time to the brute,
at another, to spiritual nature.</p>

in relation to the same principle of inequality of the organs, the explanation

of irregularity in the forms which he had assigned to them, has been
compelled to avail himself of the inequality of the size of the congenerous
organs. He soon repented having established an uniform
principle; and in this case for example, he is near being condemned
by the very sentence which he has himself pronounced. The locomotive
system, in fact, the symmetry of which no person before him
thought of denying, is destitute of it according to the principle he has
established, since it presents in its two halves an inequality of size and
action. In order to avoid this consequence, Bichat has maintained that
the inequality of size arose from the inequality of action, and that this
was the result, not of an original disposition, but of our social habits
only. To prove this assertion, he has been compelled to heap sophism
on sophism; he cannot in this case be suspected of a wish to deceive;
he was convinced of the truth of the principle, and we know that to
prove what is believed to be true, the weakest reasons always seem
to be sufficient. But these very errors should be turned to our advantage,
by showing us how dangerous is the tendency of generalizing
upon every thing, since it was capable of misleading so judicious a
mind.
</p>
<p>
Without stopping to refute in detail all the reasons which he has
advanced to support his opinion, we cannot help saying something of
them; and in the first place, the difference of size uniformly exists; it
is evident that it does not arise from great exercise, since it is found in
the infant at birth, and the nourishing artery of the right arm is larger
than that of the left. If the right arm be not really stronger than the
other, why should we always use it in preference? If we employ it in
writing, should we say with Bichat, that it is only because it is better
situated to move from left to right, in the order in which the characters
of our writing succeed each other; might it not be said, with more
reason, that our letters go from left to right, because it is the direction
in which the right hand most easily traces them? All this besides
relates merely to the form of our characters, since all the oriental
languages are written from right to left; yet it is always done with the
right hand. Is it still said that the necessity of union in battle has led
to the employment of the right arm to hold the weapons, as if the
Hurons or Algonquins fought in close ranks like our Grenadiers. If this
use of the same arm or the same leg was only conventional, why among
some people, is the left side never preferred?</p></div>

<br />
<span class="fs50">GENERAL DIFFERENCES OF THE TWO LIVES WITH RESPECT
TO DURATION OF ACTION.</span></h3>


<p>One of the great distinguishing characters of the phenomena
of the animal life in opposition to those of the
organic life, has just been shewn. That, which I am about
to examine, is not of less importance. The functions
of the animal life intermit; the functions of the organic
life are performed with an uninterrupted continuity.</p>


<h4>I. <em>Of continuity of action in the organic life.</em></h4>

<p>Prolong but little the causes which are capable of
suspending respiration, or the circulation of the blood,
and life itself shall be suspended, nay, even annihilated.
All the secretions go on uninterruptedly; if they intermit
at all (and those of the bile and saliva for instance, when
not immediately required for the purposes of digestion
and mastication, may be said to intermit) such intermissions
affect the intensity of the secretion only, and not
the entire exercise of the function. Exhalation and
absorption incessantly succeed each other; the process<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
of nutrition must be continually carried on; the double
movement of assimilation and decomposition from which
it results, can only be terminated with life itself.</p>

<p>In this concatenation of the organic phenomena, each
function depends immediately upon those which precede
it. The centre of them all, the circulation, is immediately
connected with the exercise of them all, for when
this is troubled, they languish, when this ceases, they cease
also. Just in the same manner the movements of a clock
all stop with the pendulum. Nor only is the general
action of the organic life connected with the heart; but
there cannot exist a single function of this nature unconnected
with all the others, for without secretion, there
can be no digestion, without exhalation no absorption,
without digestion no nutrition. Hence as a general
character of the organic functions may be indicated continuity
of action, and mutual dependence.</p>


<h4>II. <em>Of intermission of action in the organic life.</em></h4>

<p>In the exercise of the functions of the animal life,
there will be regularly seen an alternation of activity
and repose, complete intermissions, and not remissions
only.</p>

<p>Fatigued by long continued action, the senses all alike
become for a time, incapable of receiving any further
impression. The ear loses its sensibility to sound, the
eye to light, the tongue to savours, the pituitary membrane
to smells, the touch to the qualities of bodies about
which it is conversant, and all this for the sole reason that
the respective functions of these different organs, have for
a long time been exercised.</p>

<p>In like manner, the brain fatigued by too great an
effort in the exercise of any of its powers, in order to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
regain its excitability, must cease to act for a period proportioned
to the duration of its preceding action. The
muscles also after having been strongly contracted, before
they can contract anew, must remain for awhile in a state
of relaxation. Hence in locomotion, and the exertion of
the voice, there must be intermissions.</p>

<p>Such then is the character peculiar to the organs of the
animal life. They cease to act because they have acted.
They become fatigued, their exhausted powers must be
renewed.</p>

<p>This intermission is sometimes general, sometimes
partial. When a single organ, for a long time has been
exercised, the others remaining inactive, it relaxes and
sleeps, the others continuing to watch.&mdash;Hence, without
doubt, proceeds the reason, why there is no immediate
dependence among the functions of this order on each
other. The senses being shut up against sensation, the
brain may still subsist in action, may remember, imagine,
or reflect. In such case the power of locomotion and the
voice also, may equally well be exercised, and these in
like manner may remain unexercised, and the activity of
the senses be in no-wise impaired.</p>

<p>Thus the animal at will may fatigue any one of the
parts of this life, and on this very account, such parts
must all of them possess a capability of being relaxed, a
power of repairing their forces in an isolated manner.
This is the partial sleep of the organs.</p>


<h4>III. <em>Application of the law of intermission of action
to the theory of sleep.</em></h4>

<p>General sleep is the sleep of all the parts. It follows
from that law, which with respect to the functions of the
animal life, enchains intermission with periods of action,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
from that law, by which this life is particularly distinguished
from the organic life.</p>

<p>Very numerous varieties are remarked in this periodical
state, to which all animals are subject. The most
complete sleep is that in which the outward life is entirely
suspended. The least perfect sleep is that which affects
one organ only; it is that of which we have just been
speaking.</p>

<p>Between these two extremes there are many intermediate
states. At times perception, locomotion, and the
voice only are suspended; the imagination, the memory,
and the judgment remaining in action. At other times,
to the exercise of the latter faculties are added those of
the locomotive organs and the voice.&mdash;Such is the sleep,
in which we dream, for dreams are nothing more than a
portion of the animal life escaped from the torpor, in
which the other portion of it is plunged.</p>

<p>Sometimes but very few of the senses have ceased their
communication with external objects. Such is that species
of somnambulism, in which to the action of the brain,
the muscles, and the larynx, are added the very distinct
actions of the ear and the sense of touch.<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>
<p>Sleep then cannot be considered as a constant and
invariable state with regard to its phenomena.&mdash;Scarcely
ever do we sleep in the same manner twice together.
A number of causes modify in applying to a greater or
less portion of the animal life the laws of intermission
of action. Its different degrees should be marked by the
different functions, which these intermissions affect.</p>

<p>But the principle of it is every where the same from
the simple relaxation of a muscle to the entire suspension
of the whole of the animal life. Its application, however,
to the different external functions, varies without
end.</p>

<p>These ideas on sleep are different, no doubt, from that
narrow system, where its cause exclusively placed in the
brain, in the heart, in the large vessels, or in the stomach,
presents an isolated and frequently an illusory phenomenon,
as the base of one of the great modifications of
life.</p>

<p>And what is the reason why light and darkness in the
natural order of things, coincide so regularly with the
activity or intermission of the external functions? The
reason is this, that during the day a thousand means of
excitement perpetually surround the animal, a thousand
causes exhaust the powers of his sensitive and locomotive
organs, fatigue them, and prepare them for a state of
relaxation, which at night is favoured by the absence
of every kind of stimulus. Thus, in the actual state of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
society, where this order is in part inverted, we assemble
about us at evening, a variety of excitants, which prolong
our waking moments, and put off until towards the first
hours of daylight, the intermission of our animal life, an
intermission, which we favour besides by removing from
the place of our repose whatever might produce sensation.</p>

<p>We may for a certain time, by multiplying the causes
of excitement about them, withdraw the organs of the
animal life from this law of intermission, which should
naturally cause them to sleep; but at last they must
undergo its influence, and nothing can any longer suspend
it. Exhausted by watching, the soldier slumbers at the
cannon’s side, the slave under the whip, the criminal in
the midst of torture.</p>

<p>We must carefully make a distinction, however, between
the natural sleep, which is the effect of lassitude,
and that, which is the consequence of some affection of
the brain, of apoplexy, or concussion, for instance. In
the latter case the senses watch, receive impressions, and
are affected as usual, but these impressions are not perceived
by the diseased sensorium; we cannot be conscious
of them. On the contrary, in ordinary sleep the senses
are affected as much, or even more than the brain.</p>

<p>From what has now been said, it follows, that the
organic life, has a longer duration than the animal life.
In fact the sum of the periods of the intermissions of the
latter, is almost equal to that of the times of its activity.
We live internally almost double the time that we exist
externally.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTE:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_13_13" id="Footnote_13_13"></a><a href="#FNanchor_13_13"><span class="label">[13]</span></a> The action of the brain is far from being preserved in somnambulism.
The thread of ideas, on the contrary, is completely broken, and this is
the most striking character which distinguishes every kind of sleep
from wakefulness. The mind then cannot reflect upon the sensations
which it receives, it abandons itself successively and without any
resistance to all those which are presented, without examining the connexion
which they can have between them. In ordinary sleep, the
senses are almost entirely blunted, the mind receives no other sensations
than those which have been derived from memory; but they
present themselves in a confused manner, without order and in such a
way as often to form the most strange and incoherent images. In
somnambulism the action of many senses, and that of hearing in
particular is preserved; the judgment of the sleeper can then exercise
itself not only upon its reminiscences, but also upon the impressions
which are transmitted to it from without. The sound of a bell or a
drum, being heard while we are in a dream, will immediately modify it.
In this way a person may gain the attention of a somnambulist, and as
the latter possesses the use of his voice, it will be seen by his answers
that his ideas can be directed at will, and led in this way wherever it
is wished; for the impressions that he receives from without, being
stronger than those which come from memory, he will almost always
obey the first.</p></div></div>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER V.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="fs50">GENERAL DIFFERENCES OF THE TWO LIVES WITH RESPECT
TO HABIT.</span></h3>


<p>Another of the great distinguishing characters of the
two lives of the animal, consists in the independence of
the one, and in the dependence of the other on habit.</p>


<h4>I. <em>Of habit in the animal life.</em></h4>

<p>In the animal life every thing is modified by habit.
The functions of this life, whether enfeebled or exhausted
by it, according to the different periods of their activity,
appear to assume a variety of characters: to estimate the
influence of habit, it is necessary to consider two things
in the effect of all sensation, the sentiment, or immediate
feeling, which we have of external objects, and the judgment
which is the result of one or more comparisons
made with respect to them. An air, for instance, strikes
the ear; the first impression made upon the organ is, we
know not why, agreeable or painful. This is sentiment&mdash;at
present let us suppose the air to be continued. We
may now endeavour to appreciate the different sounds of
which it is composed, and to distinguish their accords.
In this we exercise the judgment. Now, on these two
things, the action of habit is inverse. It enfeebles our
sentiment of things, it improves our judgment of them;
the more we regard an object, the less are we sensible of
its agreeable or painful qualities, the better, at the same
time, may we judge of its attributes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span></p>


<h4>II. <em>Habit blunts the sentiment.</em></h4>

<p>Let us dwell a little on the foregoing proposition; we
have said that it is the property of habit to enfeeble our
sentiments of things, to bring us into a state of indifference,
the middle term betwixt pain and pleasure. But
before we set about to prove an assertion so remarkable,
it will be well to fix the sense of it with some precision.
Pain and pleasure are absolute and relative.<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> The instrument
which tears us in pieces is a cause of absolute
pain. Sexual connexion is a pleasure of the same nature.
Again, the view of a beautiful country delights us, but
here the enjoyment is relative to the actual state of the
mind only; its charms have long since been indifferent
to the inhabitant of the spot. A bougie when for the
first time passed into the urethra is painful to the patient;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span>
eight days afterwards he is no longer sensible of it.
Here we have comparative pain. Whatever destroys the
texture of the organ is always productive of an absolute
sensation; the simple contact of bodies at no time produces
any other than a relative sensation.</p>

<p>Hence it is evident that the domain of absolute pleasure
or pain, is much less extensive than that of these feelings
when relative. The very words agreeable, or painful,
imply a comparison made between the impression received
by the senses, and the state of mind on which it is
received. Now it is manifest that we could have referred
only to relative pain and pleasure, as being submitted to
the influence of habit. On these we shall occupy ourselves
awhile.</p>

<p>And to shew that they are gradually worn away by
habit as we have said, to the point of indifference, a
variety of proofs may be adduced. Every foreign body
in contact for the first time, with a mucous membrane, is
creative of a disagreeable sensation, which by repetition,
is diminished, and at last becomes altogether imperceptible.
Pessaries in the vagina, tents in the rectum, the
canula made use of for tying polypi of the nose, or the
uterus, bougies, in the urethra, in the œsophagus, or
trachea, styles and setons in the lachrymal passages, present
us every day with these phenomena. The impressions
of which the cutaneous organ is the seat, are all of
them subjected to the same law. The sudden passage
from cold to heat, or from heat to cold, is always the
occasion of a disagreeable sensation, but such sensation
gradually and at last entirely disappears, if the temperature
of the atmosphere be within a certain range and
constant. From hence proceed those various sensations,
which we have from the change of climate, or season.
Similar phenomena in the same way are the result of our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
successive perceptions of the dry or humid, the soft, or
the hard qualities of bodies, and in general the same
may be said of all our relative sensations, of what kind
soever.</p>

<p>With respect to pleasure, we shall repeat what we
have said of pain. The perfumer and the cook are by
no means sensible in their several professions of those
pungent enjoyments of which they are dispensers. In
them the habit of perceiving has blunted the sentiment.
The same is the case with all agreeable sensations whatever.
Delightful views and delicious music are productive
of a pleasure, the vivacity of which is soon lessened;
for harmony and beauty if they for a long time continue
to solicit our attention, are successively the sources
of pleasure, of indifference, of satiety, nay even of disgust
and aversion. This remark has been felt by all;
Philosophers and Poets have all of them turned it to their
account.</p>

<p>From whence arises this facility, which our sensations
have of undergoing so many different, so many contrary
modifications? To conceive it, let us first remark that
the centre of these revolutions of pleasure, of pain, and of
indifference, is by no means seated in the organs, which
receive or transmit the sensation, but in the soul. The
affections of the eye, of the tongue, and the ear, are at
all times the same from the same objects, but to these
affections at different times, we attach a variety of sentiments.
In the second place we shall observe, that the
action of the mind in each several sentiment of pain or
pleasure, which has been the effect of a sensation, consists
in a comparison between this sensation, and that by
which it has been preceded, a comparison, which is not
the result of reflection, but the involuntary effect of the
first impression of the object. Now, the greater the difference<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
between the actual and the past impression, the
livelier will be the sentiment. The sensations which
affect us the most, are those which we never before have
experienced.</p>

<p>The consequence is, that in proportion as the same
sensations are repeated, the less impression do they make
upon us, because the comparison between the present and
the past becomes less sensible. Pain then and pleasure
naturally tend to their own annihilation. The art of
prolonging our enjoyments, consists in varying their
causes. Indeed were I to regard the laws of our material
organization only, I might almost say, that constancy is
but one of the happy dreams of the poet, and that the
sex to which we at present bend, would possess but a very
weak hold upon our attentions were their charms too uniform;
I might almost assert that were every female cast in
the same mould, such mould would be the tomb of love.
But here let us forbear to insist upon the principles of
physiology, where they tend to the destruction of those
of morality. The one, and the other are equally solid,
though sometimes at variance. We shall only notice,
that at times the former unhappily are our only guides.
It is then, that love disappears, with the pleasure which
it has procured, and leaves us but disgust. It is then, that
recollection too often carries us aside from our duties in
rendering uniform that which we feel and that which we
have felt, for such appears to be the essence of physical
happiness, that past pleasure enfeebles the attraction of
that which we enjoy.</p>

<p>The consequences are clear. Physical pleasure is
nothing but a comparative sentiment; it ceases to exist
when uniformity supervenes between the actual and past
impression. By means of this uniformity habit must
bring down pleasure to indifference: Such is the secret<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
of the very great influence which it exercises over our
enjoyments.</p>

<p>Such also is its mode of action on our pains. Time
flies, it is said, and carries away sorrow; time is the true
remedy of grief; and wherefore? The reason is, that
the more sensations it accumulates upon that which has
been painful, the more does it enfeeble the sentiment of
comparison between what we are, and what we were.
At last this sentiment becomes extinct. There are no
eternal sorrows.</p>


<h4>III. <em>Habit improves the judgment.</em></h4>

<p>I have just now proved that the sentiment is enfeebled
by the effect of habit. It is as easy to demonstrate, that
habit improves and enlarges the judgment.</p>

<p>When, for the first time, the eye wanders over an
extensive country, or the ear is struck by a succession of
harmonious proportions; when the taste, or the smell for
the first time are affected by any very compound savour
or scent, there arise from these sensations only confused
and inexact ideas. We represent to ourselves the whole,
its parts escape us. But let these sensations be repeated,
and in proportion as they are so, will the judgment
become precise and rigorous, and the knowledge of the
object be perfected.</p>

<p>Let us for instance observe the man, who a stranger to
theatrical amusement of every kind is introduced to the
Opera. He will have but a very imperfect notion of it.
The dancing, the music, the scenery, the actors, the
splendor of the whole will be all confounded within his
mind in a sort of delightful chaos. But let him be
present at many representations, and whatever in this
charming whole belongs to the several arts, will assume<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
its separate place. He will have seized its detail, may
form a judgment of it, and this he will do the more
accurately in proportion to his opportunities of observation.</p>

<p>The above example affords us an abridgment of the
picture of the man, who enjoys for the first time the
spectacle of nature. The child, at its birth, is only capable
of general impressions, but habitude, by gradually
blunting these impressions, enables him to seize the
particular attributes of bodies, and teaches him to see, to
hear, to smell, to taste and to touch, by making him in
each sensation descend successively from the confused
notion of the whole to the precise idea of its parts. The
animal life needs education, and this is one of its great
characters.</p>

<p>Habit then while it hebetates our sentiments, improves
our judgments of things. An example will render this
truth indisputable. Most persons may recollect that in
traversing a meadow, embellished with a variety of
flowers, they have been sensible of a general fragrance
only, the confused assemblage of all the particular odours
which are exhaled from each individual flower; but in a
short time from habit this first sentiment is weakened, it
is soon afterwards altogether effaced. They then may
have distinguished the odour of each particular plant, and
formed a judgment at first impossible.</p>

<p>The two contrary operations thus of habit on our sentiments
and judgments, tend as we see to one common end,
the improvement, namely, of the animal life.</p>


<h4>IV. <em>Of habit in the organic life.</em></h4>

<p>Let us at present compare the above-mentioned phenomena
with those of the organic life, and the latter we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
shall see as constantly withdrawn from the influence of
habit, as the former are subject to it.&mdash;Habit has never
modified the circulation, or respiration, has never changed
the mode of the processes of exhalation, absorption, or
nutrition. A thousand causes would every day endanger
our very existence, were these essential functions under
the influence of habit.</p>

<p>The excretion of the urine and fecal matter may, nevertheless,
be suspended, accelerated, and return according
to laws determined by habit. The action of the stomach
with respect to hunger, and its contact with certain
aliments, appears also to be subordinate to habit; but
here let us remark, that these different phenomena hold,
as it were, a middle place between the two lives, are
found on the limits of the one and the other, and participate
almost as much of the animal as the organic life. In
fact, they all of them take place on mucous membranes,
a species of organ, which being at all times in relation
with bodies foreign to our nature, is the seat of an inward
tact, in every way analogous to the outward tact of the
skin. The two must be necessarily subject to the same
laws.&mdash;Can we be astonished at the influence of habit on
both of them?</p>

<p>We cannot, and let us remark also, that the greater
part of these phenomena, which begin as it were, and
terminate the organic life, are connected with motions
essentially voluntary, and in consequence, under the
dominion of the animal life.</p>

<p>I shall not here enlarge on the numerous modifications
of power, taste, and desire, which have their source in
habit. I refer to the numerous works which have considered
its influence in a different point of view from that
which I have indicated.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTE:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_14_14" id="Footnote_14_14"></a><a href="#FNanchor_14_14"><span class="label">[14]</span></a> Pleasure and pain are always absolute sensations, but they may
depend upon relative circumstances; that degree of cold, for example,
does not incommode the inhabitant of Spitzbergen, which would be
very painful to a man from a temperate climate. In order to understand
how habit produces these effects, we must recollect that the
repetition of the same sensations on the same part exhausts at length the
sensibility of it. Hence we may conceive how the contact of a body
upon a living surface may cease to be painful, while any division or
solution of continuity of one of our organs will be always more or less
so, because the nerves that are divided are unaccustomed to this
sensation, and still possess their whole sensibility. The sense of sight
furnishes us with a striking example of sensibility being exhausted by
the continuation of the sensation; if we look for a long time with the
same eye upon a white surface with a red spot in the middle of it, and
then look upon a part that is all white, we shall perceive there a
greenish spot; for the part of the retina which has been a long time in
contact with the red rays, loses the peculiar sensibility that enables it
to transmit this sensation perfectly; and of all the coloured rays which
compose the white rays that now go to it, it transmits only those to
which it is unacquainted; hence results the sensation of green.</p></div></div>

<br />
<span class="fs50">GENERAL DIFFERENCES OF THE TWO LIVES WITH RESPECT
TO MENTAL AFFECTION.</span></h3>


<p>It is necessary to consider, under two relations, those
acts, which little connected with the material organization
of animals, are derived from this principle so little
known in its nature, but so remarkable as to its effects, the
centre of all their voluntary motions, and on the subject
of which, there would have been less dispute, if philosophers,
instead of attempting to reach its essence, had been
contented with analyzing its operations. These actions,
which we shall consider more especially in man, with
whom they are the most perfect, are either purely intellectual,
and relative to the understanding only; or they
are the immediate product of the passions. Examined
under the first point of view, they are the exclusive attribute
of the animal, under the second of the organic life.</p>


<h4>I. <em>Whatever relates to the understanding belongs to
the animal life.</em></h4>

<p>It would be useless for me to insist on proving that
meditation, reflection, the judgment, and all the operations
of the mind depending upon an association of ideas
are under the dominion of the animal life. We judge
from impressions formerly or actually received, or from
those which we ourselves create. Perception, memory,
and the imagination are the principal bases, on which are
founded the operations of the mind, but these very bases
themselves repose upon the action of the senses.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us suppose a man at his birth to be deprived of all
that exterior apparatus, which is destined to establish his
connexions with surrounding objects; such man will not
altogether be the statue of Condillac, because, as we shall
see hereafter, other causes besides the sensations, may
occasion within him the motions of the animal life; but
at least will he not be able, a stranger as he is to every
thing surrounding him, to form any judgment with respect
to things. The intellectual functions with him will be
null; volition, which is the consequence of these functions,
will not have place, and consequently, that very
extensive class of motions which has its immediate seat
in the brain, and which itself is but an effect of the
impressions made there, will in nowise belong to him.</p>

<p>It is by means of the animal life that man is so great,
so superior to the beings, which surround him; by means
of this that he possesses the sciences, the arts, and every
thing which places him at a distance from the gross
elements under which we represent brute matter; by this
that he approaches spirituality; for industry and commerce,
and whatever enlarges the narrow circle within
which the efforts of other animals are confined, are exclusively
under the dominion of the animal life of man.</p>

<p>The actual state of society then is nothing but a more
regular development, a more marked perfection of the
exercise of the different functions of this life; for one of
its greatest characters as I shall hereafter prove, consists
in its capability of being unfolded, while, in the organic
life, there does not exist a part, which in the least degree
may pass the limits which are set to it by nature. We
live organically in as perfect, in as regular a way, when
infants, as when men; but what is the animal life of the
child compared with that of the man of thirty years of
age?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>We may conclude that the brain, the central organ of
the animal life, is the centre of whatever relates to the
understanding. I might here proceed to speak of its
volume in man, and in animals, whose intelligence appears
to decrease in proportion as the facial angle is diminished,
and expatiate upon the different alterations of which
the cerebral cavity is the seat, as well as on the disorders
of the intellectual functions arising thence. But these
things are all of them well enough understood. Let us
pass to that order of phenomena, which though as foreign
as the preceding to the ideas which we form of material
appearances, are elsewhere seated.</p>


<h4>II. <em>Whatever relates to the passions belongs to the
organic life.</em></h4>

<p>My present object is not to consider the passions
metaphysically. It little matters, whether they be all of
them the modifications of a single passion, or dependent
each of them upon a separate principle. We shall only
remark, that many physicians in discussing their influence
on the organic phenomena, have not sufficiently
distinguished them from the sensations; the latter are the
occasion of the passions, but differ from them widely.</p>

<p>It is true that anger, joy, and sorrow, would not affect
us, were we not to find their causes in our connexions
with external objects. It is true also, that the senses are
the agents of these relations, that they communicate the
causes of the passions, but in this they act as simple
conductors only, and have nothing in common with the
affections, which they produce; for sensation of every
kind has its centre in the brain, sensation of every kind
supposing impression and perception. If the action of
the brain be suspended, sensation ceases; on the contrary,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
the brain is never affected by the passions; their seat is
in the organs of the internal life.<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>It is undoubtedly surprising that the passions, essentially
as they enter into our relations with the beings
which are placed about us, that modifying as they do at
every moment these relations, that animating, enlarging,
and exalting the phenomena of the animal life, which
without them would be nothing but a cold series of intellectual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[58]</a></span>
movements; it is astonishing, I say, that the
passions should neither have their end, nor beginning
in the organs of this life, but on the contrary, that the
parts which serve for the internal functions, should be
constantly affected by them, and even occasion them
according to the state in which they are found. Such
notwithstanding is the result of the strictest observation.</p>

<p>I shall first observe, that the effect of every kind of
passion is at all times to produce some change in the
organic life. Anger accelerates the circulation of the
blood, it multiplies the efforts of the heart. The passion
of joy has not indeed so marked an influence upon the
circulation, but alters it notwithstanding, and carries it
lightly towards the skin. Terror acts inversely; this
passion being characterized by a feebleness in the vascular
system, a feebleness, which in hindering the blood from
arriving at the capillary vessels, occasions the paleness
which at such time is so particularly remarked. The
effects of sadness and sorrow are nearly analogous.</p>

<p>So great indeed is the effect which the passions occasion
upon the organs of the circulation, as even to arrest
them altogether in their functions, where the affection is
very powerful. In this way is syncope produced, for the
primitive seat of syncope is always, as I shall soon prove
it to be, in the heart, and not in the brain. In this the
latter organ ceases to act, only because it ceases to receive
the excitant necessary to its action. Hence also may happen
death itself, the sometimes sudden effect of extreme
emotion, whether such emotion as in anger so far exalts
and exhausts the powers of the circulation, as not to leave
them any further excitability, or whether as in the death
occasioned by excessive grief, the powers at once excessively
debilitated, are no longer capable of returning to
their usual condition.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>If the total and instantaneous cessation of the circulation
be not occasioned by this debility, a variety of lesions
in the blood vessels may be, notwithstanding, the effect
of it. Desault has remarked that diseases of the heart,
and aneurisms of the aorta, were augmented in number
during the revolution, in proportion to the evils which it
produced.</p>

<p>Nor does respiration depend less immediately upon
the passions; that oppression, that anxiety, and sense of
suffocation, which is the sudden effect of profound sorrow,
must imply in the lungs a remarkable change and sudden
alteration. In that very long series of chronic or acute
affections, the sad attribute of the pulmonary system,
must we not often look to the passions to find the principle
of the disease?</p>

<p>And that lively sensation at the pylorus under strong
emotion, that ineffaceable impression which sometimes
remains there, from whence succeed the schirri of which
it is the seat, that sentiment of stricture, as it were,
about the stomach, about the cordia in particular; under
other circumstances those spasmodic vomitings, which
sometimes follow the loss of a beloved object, the news
of a fatal accident, or any kind of trouble, the cause of
which are the passions; that sudden interruption of the
digestive phenomena either in consequence of agreeable
or disagreeable news, those affections of the bowels,
those organic lesions of the intestines, of the spleen
observed in cases of melancholy, or hypochondria, diseases
which are always preceded by sad forebodings and
the darker affections of the mind; do not all these indicate
the very strict connexion of the digestive viscera with
the state of the passions?</p>

<p>They do; and the secreting organs have not a less
connexion with them. Sudden fear suspends the course<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span>
of the bile, and is the occasion of jaundice; sudden
anger is often the origin of bilious fever. In a state of
sorrow or joy, sometimes even in that of admiration, our
tears flow abundantly: the pancreas is not less frequently
affected in hypochondria.</p>

<p>But the functions of the circulation, of digestion, respiration
and secretion, are those which are most directly
under the influence of the passions; those of exhalation,
absorption and nutrition appear to be less so. Doubtless,
the reason of this is, that these functions have not as the
former any principal focus, or essential viscera, the state
of which may be compared with that of the mind. Their
phenomena disseminated throughout all the organs belong
exclusively to none, and cannot be observed as well as
those, the effects of which are confined within a narrow
compass.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the alterations, which these functions
experience are not less real, do not become less apparent
after a certain time; let the man, whose hours are marked
by sorrow, be compared with him, who lives in peace of
mind, and the difference of the process of nutrition in
the one and in the other will easily be seen.</p>

<p>Let us, for a moment, approximate the times, when the
terrible passions of sorrow, of fear and revenge seemed
to brood over our country, and those, when safety and
abundance continually supplied us with the gayer ones so
natural to us; we may then recall what at the two periods
were the outward appearances of our countrymen, and
appreciate the influence of the passions on the process of
nutrition. The very expressions which are continually
in our mouths that such a one is dried up with envy,
preyed upon by remorse, consumed and wasted away
with sorrow, do not even these announce how much the
nutritive functions are modified by the passions?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span></p>

<p>I know not for what reason the powers of absorption
and exhalation should not be subject to the same influence,
though they appear to be less so; may not dropsies, and
all infiltrations of the cellular membrane, the peculiar
vices of these two functions, depend on mental affection?</p>

<p>In the midst of these disturbances, of these partial or
general revolutions which are produced by the passions
in the organic phenomena, let us consider the actions of
the animal life; they constantly remain unaltered, or if
they do experience any derangement, such derangement
has ever its source in the internal functions.</p>

<p>From so many considerations we may conclude that it
is upon the organic and not upon the animal life that the
passions exercise their influence. Accordingly, whatever
serves to paint them must relate to the former. Of this
assertion, our gestures which are the mute expressions
both of the sentiment and understanding are a remarkable
proof. Thus if we indicate any operation of the memory,
imagination or judgment, the hand is carried to the head;
do we wish to express either love or hatred, or joy or
sorrow, it is to the seat of the heart, the stomach or intestines,
that it is then directed.</p>

<p>The actor, who should mistake in this respect, who in
speaking of sorrow should refer his gestures to his head,
or carry them to his heart, for the purpose of announcing
an effort of genius, would be ridiculed for a reason which
we should better feel than comprehend.</p>

<p>The very language of the vulgar, at a time when the
learned referred to the brain, as the seat of the soul,
affections of all kinds, distinguished the respective attributes
of the two lives. We have always said a strong
head, a head well organized to denote perfection of mind;
a good heart, a sensible heart, to indicate proper feeling.
The expressions of fury circulating in the veins, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
stirring up the bile; of joy making the heart leap, of
jealousy distilling its passions into the heart, are by no
means poetical expressions, but the enunciation of that
which actually takes place in nature. In this way do all
these expressions, the language of the internal functions
enter into our poetry, which in consequence is the
language of the passions or the organic life, as ordinary
speech, is that of the understanding or the animal life.
Declamation holds a middle place between the two, and
animates the cold language of the brain by the expressive
language of the inward organs.</p>

<p>I shall even venture to assert that anger and love
inoculate, if I may so express myself, into the humours,
into the saliva particularly, a radical vice, which renders
dangerous the bite of animals at such times; for these
passions do really distil into the fluids a poison, as we
indicate the fact by our common expressions. The
violent passions of the nurse have frequently given her
milk a pernicious quality, from whence disease has followed
to the child; and in the same way shall we explain
from the modifications which the blood of the mother
receives under strong emotion, the manner, in which
these emotions operate on the nutrition, the conformation,
and even on the life of the fœtus. And not only
do the passions essentially influence the organic functions,
in affecting their respective viscera, but the state
of these viscera, their lesions, the variation of their forces
concur in a decided way to the production of the passions
themselves. Their relations with age and temperament,
establish incontestably this fact.</p>

<p>Who does not know for instance, that the individual
of the sanguine temperament, whose expansion of lungs
is great, whose circulatory system is large and strong;
who does not know that such a man is possessed of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
disposition to anger and violence? that when the bilious
system prevails, the passions of envy and hatred are
more particularly developed? that when the lymphatic
system is pronounced, are pronounced also the inactivity
and dulness of the individual?</p>

<p>In general that which characterises any particular temperament,
consists in a correspondent modification on one
hand of the passions, and on the other of the state of
the organic viscera. The animal life is almost always a
stranger to the attributes of the temperaments.</p>

<p>The same may be said of age; the weakness of the
organization of the child coincides with his timidity.
The development of the pulmonary and vascular system,
with the courage and temerity of the youth; that of the
liver, and the gastric system with the envy, ambition and
intrigue of manhood.</p>

<p>In considering the passions as affected by climate and
season, the same relations are observed between them
and the organic functions; but physicians have sufficiently
noticed these analogies, and it would be useless to repeat
them.</p>

<p>At present, if from man in a state of health, we look
to man in a state of disease, we shall see that the lesions
of the liver, of the stomach, of the spleen, the intestines
and heart produce a variety of alterations in our affections,
which all of them cease together with their causes.</p>

<p>The ancients, better than our modern mechanicians,
then were acquainted with the laws of the economy,
in supposing that our bad affections were evacuated by
purgatives, together with the noxious humours of the
body. By disembarrassing the primæ viæ they got rid
of these affections. In fact how dark a tint does the
fulness of the gastric viscera cast upon the countenance!
the errors of the first physicians on the subject of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
atrabilis, were a proof of the precision of their observations
on the connexion of these organs with the state of
the mind.</p>

<p>In this way every thing tends to prove, that the organic
life, is the term, in which the passions end, and the centre
from whence they originate. But we shall be asked
perhaps, why vegetables, which live organically, do not
offer any vestige of them? the reason seems to be, that
besides their want of the natural excitants of the passions,
namely the external apparatus of the senses, they are
wanting also in those internal organs, which concur most
especially to their production, such as the digestive
system, that of the general circulation, and that of the
great secretions, which are remarked in animals.</p>

<p>Such are the reasons also why the passions are so
obscure in the Zoophytes, in worms, &amp;c. and why in
proportion as the organic life becomes more simple in
the series of animals, and loses its important viscera, the
passions are less observable.</p>


<h4>III. <em>The passions modify the actions of the animal
life though seated in the organic life.</em></h4>

<p>Although the passions are the especial attributes of
the organic life, they nevertheless exert an influence over
the animal life, which it is necessary to examine. The
muscles of volition are frequently brought into play, and
their actions sometimes exalted, sometimes lowered by
them; the strength for instance of the man in anger is
doubled, and tripled; is exercised with an energy, of
which he is not himself the master. The source of this
augmented power is manifestly in the heart.</p>

<p>This organ, as I shall prove hereafter, is the natural
excitant of the brain, by means of the blood, which it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span>
sends thither. The energy of the cerebral action is in
proportion to the energy of the stimulus applied to it, and
we have seen that the effect of anger is to impress a great
vivacity upon the circulation; hence, a larger quantity of
blood than usual is thrown upon the brain in a given time.
The consequence is an effect analogous to that which
happens in the paroxysm of ardent fever, or the immoderate
use of wine.</p>

<p>It is then, that the brain being excited strongly, excites
as strongly the muscles which are submitted to its influence;
accordingly their motions must be involuntary, for
the will is a stranger to those spasms, which are determined
by a cause which irritates the medullary organ. Such
cause may be a splinter of bone, blood, pus, the handle
of a scalpel as in our experiments; in short of various
kinds.</p>

<p>The analogy is exact, the blood being transmitted to
the brain in greater quantity than usual, produces upon
it the effect of the different excitants above mentioned.
In these different motions then, the brain is passive; it
engenders indeed at all times the necessary irradiations
for producing such motions, but these irradiations in the
present instance are not the effect of the will.</p>

<p>It may be observed also, that under the influence of
anger, a constant relation exists between the contractions
of the heart and the locomotive organs; they both increase
at the same time, and at the same time resume their equilibrium.
In every other case on the contrary there is
no appearance of this relation; the action of the heart is
uniformly the same, whatever the affection of the muscular
system. In convulsion and palsy, the circulation is
neither impeded nor accelerated.</p>

<p>In the passion of anger, in fact, we see the very mode
of the influence, which the organic life exercises over the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
animal life. In the passion of fear also, where on the one
hand the enfeebled heart directs a less quantity of blood,
and consequently a smaller cause of excitement to the
brain, and where on the other hand a debility may be
observed in the external muscles, we may perceive the
connexion of cause and effect. This passion offers in the
first degree the phenomenon, which in the last degree is
shewn by those lively emotions, which suspending altogether
the efforts of the heart, occasion a sudden cessation
of the animal life and syncope.</p>

<p>But in what way shall we account for those modifications
of the motions of the animal life, which are the
effect of the passions? In what way shall we explain
the cause of those infinite varieties, which succeed each
other in the moveable picture of the face?</p>

<p>All the muscles which are the agents of these motions
receive their nerves from the brain and lie under the
influence of the will. What is the reason then, that
when acted on by the passions, they cease to do so, and
enter under the class of those motions of the organic life,
which are put forth without our direction or consciousness.
The following if I mistake not is the best explanation
of the fact.</p>

<p>The most numerous sympathies exist between the
internal viscera, and the brain or its different parts.
Every step which we make in practice presents us with
affections of the brain originating sympathetically from
those of the liver, stomach and intestines. Now as the
effect of every kind of passion is to produce a change of
power in one or the other of these viscera, such change
will sympathetically excite either the whole of the brain
or some of its parts, whose re-action upon the muscles,
which receive from thence their nerves, will produce the
motions, which are then observed. In the production of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
these motions the cerebral organ accordingly must be passive,
it is active only when the will presides over its efforts.</p>

<p>The effects indeed of the passions are similar to those
diseases of the internal organs, which by sympathy are
the causes of atony, palsy, and spasm.</p>

<p>But perhaps the inward organs act upon the voluntary
muscles, not by means of the immediate excitement of
the brain, but by direct nervous communication. Of
what importance to us is the manner? We are not at
present occupied on the so much agitated question of the
manner of sympathetic communication.</p>

<p>The essential thing is the fact itself. Now in this fact,
there are two things evident; the affection of an internal
organ by the passions, and secondly a motion produced
in consequence of such affection in muscles, on which
this organ in the common series of the phenomena of
the two lives has no kind of influence. This is surely a
sympathy, for between it, and those with which convulsion,
or spasm of the face present us, when occasioned
by any lesion of the phrenic centre, or the stomach, the
difference is only in the cause, which affects the internal
organ.</p>

<p>Any irritation of the uvula, or the pharynx convulsively
agitates the diaphragm. The too frequently
repeated use of fermented liquors occasions a general
trembling of the body. But that which happens in one
mode of gastric affection, may happen in another. What
matters it, whether the stomach or liver be irritated by
passion or by some material cause? It is from the affection,
and not from the cause of the affection that results
the sympathy.</p>

<p>Such in general is the manner in which the passions
withdraw from the empire of the will, those motions
which by nature are voluntary. Such is the manner in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
which they appropriate to themselves, if I may so
express myself, the phenomena of the animal life, though
they possess their seat essentially in the organic life.</p>

<p>When very strong, the very lively affection of the
internal organs produces so impetuously the sympathetic
motions of the muscles, that the action of the brain is
absolutely null upon them; but the first impression past,
the ordinary mode of locomotion returns.</p>

<p>A man is informed by letter and in presence of company,
of a piece of news, which it is his interest to
conceal. All on a sudden his brows become contracted,
he grows pale, and his features are moulded according to
the nature of the passion, which has been excited. These
are sympathetic phenomena produced by the abdominal
viscera which have been affected by the passions, and
which in consequence belong to the organic life. But in
a short time the man is capable of putting a constraint
upon himself, his countenance clears up, his colour
returns. Meanwhile the interior sentiment continues to
subsist however, but the voluntary have overpowered the
sympathetic motions, the action of the brain has surmounted
that of the stomach or the liver; the animal
life of the man has resumed its empire.</p>

<p>In almost all the passions the movements of the animal
life are mingled with those of the organic life, or succeed
to them; in almost all the passions, the muscular action
is in part directed by the brain, in part by the organic
viscera. The two centres alternately overpowered the
one by the other, or remaining in a state of equilibrium,
constitute by the modifications of their influence, those
numerous varieties which are seen in our mental affections.</p>

<p>And not only on the brain, but on all the other parts
of the body also do the viscera affected by the passions
exercise their sympathetic influence. Fear affects the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
stomach in the first place, as is proved by the sense of
stricture felt there at such time.<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> But when thus affected,
the organ re-acts upon the skin, with which it has so
strict a connexion, and the skin immediately becomes the
seat of the cold and sudden sweat, which is then so often
felt. This sweat is still however of the same nature with
that which is occasioned by tea, or warm liquids. Thus
a glass of cold water, or a current of cold air, will suppress
this excretion by means of the relation, which
exists between the skin, and the mucous surfaces of the
stomach or bronchiæ. We must carefully distinguish
between sympathetic sweating, and that, of which the
cause is directly made upon the skin.</p>

<p>Hence though the brain be not the only term of the
re-action of the internal viscera which are affected by
the passions, it is nevertheless the principal one, and in
this respect may always be considered as a focus at all
times in opposition to that which is centered in the internal
organs.</p>


<h4>IV. <em>Of the epigastric centre.&mdash;It does not exist in the
sense, which Authors have pretended.</em></h4>

<p>Authors have never been at variance with respect to
the cerebral focus. The voluntary motions have ever<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
been regarded as an effect of its irradiations. They do
not equally agree upon the subject of the epigastric focus;
some of them place it in the diaphragm, others in the
pylorus, others in the plexus of the great sympathetic
nerve.<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>
<p>But on this point, they appear to me to be all of them
in the wrong. They assimilate or rather identify the
second with the first focus&mdash;they think, that the passions,
as well as the sensations have their seat in an invariable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
centre. That, which has led them to this opinion has
been the sentiment of oppression, which is felt at the
cardia under all painful affection.</p>

<p>But it is to be remarked, that in the internal organs,
the sentiment produced by the affection of a part is always
an unfaithful index of the seat and extent of such affection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
For example, hunger must undoubtedly affect the whole
of the stomach, but the sensation of hunger is transmitted
to us only by the cardia. A large inflamed surface in
the pleura for the most part gives rise to a pain, which is
felt only in a point. How often does it happen that in
the head or the abdomen a pain which is referred but to
a very limited space coincides with a largely disseminated
affection, with an affection possessing even a different seat
from that which is presumed. We should never consider
the place to which we refer the sentiment as a sure index
of that which the affection occupies, but only as a sign
that it exists either there or thereabouts.</p>

<p>From all this it follows, that to form a judgment of the
organ, to which such or such a passion relates, we ought
to recur to the effect produced in the functions of the
organ by the influence of the passion, and not to the feelings
of the patient. In setting out from this principle it
will be easy to see, that it is sometimes the stomach
and alimentary canal, sometimes the sanguiferous system,
sometimes the viscera belonging to the secretions which
experience a change.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span></p>

<p>I shall not repeat the proofs of this assertion, but supposing
it to be demonstrated, I shall assert that there does
not exist for the passions as there does for the sensations
a fixed and constant centre; that on the contrary the
liver, the lungs, the spleen, the stomach, and the heart,
are turn by turn affected, and at such time form that
epigastric centre so celebrated in modern works; and if
in general we refer to this region the sensible impression
of all our affections, the reason is that all the important
viscera of the organic life, are there concentrated. In
fact, if nature had separated these viscera, had the liver
for instance been placed in the pelvis, and the stomach in
the neck, the heart and spleen remaining as they now
are seated, in such case the epigastric focus would disappear,
and the local sentiment of our passions vary according
to the part affected.</p>

<p>In determining the facial angle, Camper has thrown
much light upon the proportion of intelligence enjoyed
by the several classes of animals. It appears that not
only the functions of the brain, but that all those of the
animal life which are centred there, have this angle for
the measure of their perfection.</p>

<p>It would be a very pleasing thing could we indicate in
the same way a measure, which assumed from the organs
of the internal life, might fix the rank of each species
with regard to the passions. The dog is much more
susceptible than other animals of the sentiments of gratitude,
of joy, of sorrow, of hatred, and of friendship; has
he any thing more perfect in his organic life? the monkey
astonishes us by his industry, his disposition to imitate,
and by his intelligence; his animal life is certainly superior
to that of every other species. Other animals, such
as the elephant, interest us by their attachment, their
affection, their passions; they delight us also with their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span>
address, and the extent of their intelligence. With them
the cerebral centre and the organic viscera are perfect
alike.</p>

<p>A rapid glance over the series of animals will show us
also, that in some of them the phenomena, which arise
from sensation predominate over those which have their
origin in the passions; in others we shall see the latter
superior in power to the former, and in others again, a
balance established between the two. These circumstances,
which we remark in the long chain of animated
beings, we may remark in the human species when considered
individually. In one man the passions are the
great principle of motion; the influence of his animal
life is continually surpassed by that of his organic life,
and incessantly induces him to act in a way to which the
will is almost a stranger, and which often entails upon
him the bitterest regret, when his animal life resumes its
empire. In another man, the animal life is the stronger
of the two. In such case, the understanding seems to
be augmented at the expense of the passions, the latter
remaining in that silence, to which the organization of
the individual has condemned them.</p>

<p>That man enjoys the happiest constitution in whom
the two lives are balanced, in whom the cerebral and
epigastric centres exercise the one upon the other an
equal action, whose intellect is warmed, exalted, and
animated by the passions, but whose judgment makes
him at all times master of their influence.</p>

<p>It is this influence of the passions over the actions of
the animal life, which composes what is named the
character. Character as well as Temperament depends
upon the organic life; possesses all its attributes, and is a
stranger to the will in all its emanations; for our exterior
actions form a picture of which the ground and design<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span>
do indeed belong to the animal life, but upon which the
organic life extends the shading and colouring of the passions.
The character of the individual is constituted by
such shades and colours.</p>

<p>The alternate predominance of the two lives has been
remarked by almost all philosophers. Plato, Marcus
Aurelius, Bacon, St. Augustine, St. Paul, Leibnitz, Van
Helmont, Buffon and many others, have recognized in
man two principles, by one of which we become the
masters of all our moral actions, by the other the contrary.
We have nothing to do with the nature of these
principles. Our business is with their phenomena; we
shall analyze the relations by which they are united.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_15_15" id="Footnote_15_15"></a><a href="#FNanchor_15_15"><span class="label">[15]</span></a> Bichat, in this paragraph, seems to say that the perceptions, which
produce in us the passions, go directly and without the intervention of
the brain, from the senses to the organs which he supposes to be affected
by them. We cannot believe that such was his idea. The paragraph
which follows must aid us in understanding it, and we shall endeavour
to elucidate it by means of an example.
</p>
<p>
A certain event happens; a man is informed of it by means of his
senses; he examines the event in itself, and its relations with antecedent
and future events; his judgment weighs the various consequences of it,
and shows them to be very disadvantageous to him. Here, as Bichat calls
it, is a cold series of intellectual phenomena, which would take place
in the individual, whoever the man may be who is affected by the event
to which he has given his attention. It is found that the man who is
injured is himself; then, from a knowledge of this only, his heart is
sympathetically affected; its motions become more rapid and stronger,
they send to the brain a greater quantity of blood, and this increase of
habitual excitement in the organ of thought, produces a kind of mental
attention in relation to the event that has taken place.
</p>
<p>
Thus, without the part that the heart has taken in it, this man would
have seen with the most perfect indifference an event most disastrous
to himself; for without even supposing anger, the least sentiment of
sadness being a passion, we cannot believe that he is affected with it,
if his liver, stomach or spleen are not at the moment in a particular
state. But does not every thing on the contrary lead us to believe that
anger exists before the agitation of the heart, and that this is the effect
of it and not the cause? This agitation of the heart without doubt, by
sending to the brain a greater quantity of blood than usual, contributes
in its turn to develop and support the kind of alienation which accompanies
anger; but it is necessary that the passion should already exist,
since a favourable event, by producing as rapid motions of the heart,
will produce nothing similar.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_16_16" id="Footnote_16_16"></a><a href="#FNanchor_16_16"><span class="label">[16]</span></a> There is no proof that the sense of stricture which is felt in the
epigastric region, is connected with the stomach; and if it were proved
that it was so, it would not follow from it that this organ was primarily
affected from fear. The same passion sometimes acts differently in
different individuals; there are some who do not feel this stricture in
the epigastric region, but who are deprived of the use of their legs;
must it be said that in these individuals the seat of fear is in the
extensor muscles of the legs? If the introduction of a warm drink
into the stomach produces an increase of cutaneous exhalation, should
we conclude from analogy, that it is by acting primarily upon this organ
that fear causes that cold sweat which sometimes accompanies it?</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_17_17" id="Footnote_17_17"></a><a href="#FNanchor_17_17"><span class="label">[17]</span></a> <em>Note by the Author.</em>&mdash;This nervous network, going principally from
the semi-lunar ganglion, belongs to almost the whole abdominal vascular
system, whose various ramifications it follows. It is, according to
the usual manner of considering it, one of the divisions of the great
sympathetic; but it seems to me that the ideas of anatomists respecting
this important nerve are not conformable to nature.
</p>
<p>
Every one considers it as a medullary cord, extending from the head
to the sacrum, sending in its course various ramifications to the neck,
the thorax and the abdomen, following in its distributions a course
analogous to those nerves of the spine, and deriving its origin from those
nerves, according to some, and from those of the brain, according to
others. Whatever be the name by which it is designated, sympathetic,
intercostal, &amp;c.; the manner of describing it is always the same.
</p>
<p>
I believe that this manner is altogether wrong, that there really exists
no nerve analogous to the one designated by these words, and that
what is taken for a nerve is only a series of communications between
different nervous centres, placed at different distances from each other.
</p>
<p>
These nervous centres are the ganglions, scattered throughout the
different regions, they have all an independent and insulated action.
Each is a particular centre which sends in various directions many
ramifications, which carry to their respective organs the irradiations of
the centre from which they go off. Among these ramifications, some
go from one ganglion to another; and as these branches which unite
the ganglions form by their union a kind of continuous cord, this has
been considered as a distinct nerve; but these branches are only communications,
simple anastomoses, and not a nerve analogous to the
others.
</p>
<p>
This is so true, that these communications are often interrupted.
There are subjects, for example, in whom is found a very distinct
interval between the pectoral and lumbar portions of what is called the
great sympathetic, which seems to be cut off in this place. I have seen
this pretended nerve cease and afterwards reappear, either in the lumbar
or sacral region. Who does not know that sometimes a single branch,
sometimes many go from one ganglion to another, especially between
the last cervical and the first dorsal; that the size of these branches
varies remarkably; and that after having furnished many divisions, the
sympathetic is larger than before it gave off any?
</p>
<p>
These considerations evidently prove that the communicating branches
of the ganglions no more suppose a continuous nerve than the branches
which go from each of the cervical, lumbar or sacral pair to the two
pair which are superior and inferior to them. In fact, notwithstanding
these communications, we consider each pair in a separate manner, and
do not regard their union as a nerve.
</p>
<p>
It is necessary to describe in the same way separately each ganglion,
and the branches which go off from it.
</p>
<p>
Hence I shall divide hereafter in my descriptions, in which I have
hitherto pursued the ordinary course, the nerves into two great systems,
one arising from the brain, and the other from the ganglions; the first
has a single centre, the second has a great number of them.
</p>
<p>
I shall first examine the divisions of the cerebral system; I shall
afterwards treat of the system of the ganglions, which may be subdivided
into those of the head, the neck, the thorax, the abdomen and
the pelvis.
</p>
<p>
In the head is found the lenticular ganglion, that of Meckel, that of
the sublingual gland, &amp;c. &amp;c. Though no communication connects
these different centres, either together or with the pretended great
sympathetic, yet their description belongs to that of the nerves of which
this is the connecting link, as the communications are arrangements
merely accidental to this system of nerves.
</p>
<p>
In the neck there are the three cervical ganglions, sometimes another
upon the side of the trachea, in the thorax the twelve thoracic, in the
abdomen the semi-lunar, the lumbar, &amp;c. and in the pelvis the sacral;
these are the different centres whose ramifications it is necessary to
examine separately, as we do those of the cerebral centre.
</p>
<p>
For example, I shall first describe the semi-lunar ganglion, as we do
the brain; then I shall examine the branches, among which, is that by
which it communicates with the thoracic ganglions, that is to say, the
great splanchnic; for it is very incorrect to consider this nerve as
giving origin to the ganglion. In the same way, in the neck and the
head, each ganglion will be first described; then I shall treat of its
branches, among which are those of communications. The arrangement
being nearly the same for the ganglions of the thorax, the pelvis
and the loins, the description of each region will be similar.
</p>
<p>
This manner of describing the nerves, by placing an evident line of
demarcation between the two systems, exhibits these two systems such
as they really are in nature.
</p>
<p>
What anatomist, in fact, has not been struck with the differences
that exist between the nerves of these two systems? Those of the
brain are larger, less numerous, whiter, more compact in their texture
and exhibit less variety. On the contrary, the extreme tenuity, great
number, especially towards the plexuses, greyish colour, remarkable
softness of texture and varieties extremely common are characters of
the nerves coming from the ganglions, if we except those of communication
with the cerebral nerves and some of those which unite together
these small nervous centres.
</p>
<p>
Besides, this division of the general system of the nerves into two
secondary ones, accords very well with that of life. We know in fact
that the external functions, the sensations, locomotion and the voice
are all dependent on the cerebral nervous system; that on the contrary,
most of the organs which perform the internal functions derive from
the ganglions their nerves, and with them the principle of their action.
We know that animal sensibility and contractility arise from the first,
and that where the second alone are found, there is only organic sensibility
and contractility.
</p>
<p>
I have said that the termination of this kind of sensibility and the
origin of the corresponding contractility are in the organ in which they
are noticed; but perhaps both the termination and origin are more
remote, and are in the ganglion from which the organ receives its nerves,
as the termination of animal sensibility and the origin of the contractility
of the same species are always in the brain. If it be so, as the ganglions
are very numerous, we can understand why the forces of organic life
do not refer, like those of animal life, to a common centre.
</p>
<p>
It is evident from these considerations, that there is no great sympathetic
nerve, and that what has been designated by this word is only an
assemblage of small nervous systems, with distinct functions, but with
communicating branches.
</p>
<p>
We see then what should be thought of the disputes of anatomists
respecting the origin of this pretended nerve, placed in the fifth, sixth
pair, &amp;c. in those of the neck, back, &amp;c.
</p>
<p>
Many physiologists have entertained concerning the ganglions opinions
similar to those which I have now offered, by considering these
bodies as small brains; but it is essential that these opinions should
enter into the description, which, as it is now made, gives a very inaccurate
idea both of these nervous centres and of the nerves which go
off from them.
</p>
<p>
The expression of <em>nervous branches giving origin to such or such a
ganglion</em>, &amp;c. resembles that in which we should consider the brain as
arising from the nerves of which it is itself the origin.</p></div>

<span class="fs50">GENERAL DIFFERENCES OF THE TWO LIVES WITH RESPECT
TO VITAL POWER.</span></h3>


<p>The greater number of Physicians, who have written
upon the vital properties, have begun by researches on
their principle, have endeavoured to descend from the
knowledge of the nature of this principle to that of its
phenomena, instead of ascending from observation to
theory. The Archæus of Van Helmont, the soul of
Stahl, the vital principle of Barthez, the vital power of
others, have each in their turn been considered as the
sole centre of every action possessing the character of
vitality, have each in their turn been made the common
base of every physiological explanation. But these bases
have every one of them been sapped, and in the midst
of their wrecks have remained the facts alone which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span>
rigorous experiment has furnished upon the subject of
sensibility and motility.</p>

<p>So narrow indeed are the limits of the human understanding,
that the knowledge of first causes has almost
always been interdicted. The veil, which covers them
envelops with its innumerable folds whoever attempts to
rend it.</p>

<p>In the study of nature, principles are certain general
results of first causes, from whence proceed innumerable
secondary results. The art of finding the connexion of
the first with the second is that of every judicious mind.
To seek the connexion of first causes with their general
effects is to walk blindfold in a road from whence a thousand
paths diverge.</p>

<p>Of what importance besides to us are these causes?
Is it necessary to know the nature of light, of oxygen
and caloric to study their phenomena? Without the
knowledge of the principle of life, cannot we analyze its
properties? In the study of animals let us proceed as
modern metaphysicians have done in that of the understanding.
Let us suppose causes, and attach ourselves to
their general results.</p>


<h4>I. <em>Difference between vital power and physical law.</em></h4>

<p>In considering the powers of life, we shall perceive in
the first place a remarkable difference between them and
the laws of physics. The first incessantly vary in their
intensity, in their energy, in their development, are continually
passing from the last degree of prostration, to the
highest pitch of exaltation, and assume under the influence
of the most trifling causes a thousand modifications; for
the animal is influenced by every thing which surrounds
him; he wakes, he sleeps, reposes or exercises himself,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
digests, or is hungry, is subject to his own passions, and
to the action of foreign bodies. On the contrary the
physical laws are invariable, the same at all times, and
the source of a series of phenomena at all times similar.
Attraction is a physical power; it is always in proportion
to the mass of brute matter in which it is observed;
sensibility is a vital power, but in the same mass of matter,
in the same organic part its quantity is perpetually
changing.</p>

<p>The invariability of the laws which preside over the
phenomena of physics, enables us to apply the formula
of calculation to all the sciences, which have them for
their object. Applied to the actions of the living body,
the mathematics can never give us formula. The return
of a comet, the resistance of a fluid in traversing an inert
canal, the rapidity of a projectile may be calculated; but
to calculate with Borelli the force of a muscle, with Keil
the velocity of the blood, with Jurine and Lavoisier the
quantity of air, which enters into the lungs, is to build
upon a quicksand, an edifice solid of itself, but necessarily
decreed to fall for want of a foundation.</p>

<p>This instability of the vital powers, this disposition,
which they continually have to change, impress upon
all the physiological phenomena a character of irregularity
which particularly distinguishes them from those
of physics. The latter forever the same, are well known
when once they have been analyzed; but who can say
that he knows the former, because he has analyzed them
under the same circumstances, a multitude of times.
The urine indeed, the saliva, or the bile indifferently
taken from such or such a subject, may be analyzed, and
hence results our animal chemistry; but such a chemistry
is the dead anatomy of the fluids, not a physiological
chemistry. The physiology of the fluids should be composed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
of the innumerable variations which they experience
according to the different states of their respective
organs.</p>

<p>The urine after taking food is not the fluid, which it is
after sleeping; it contains in winter, principles which are
foreign to it, during summer, when the principal excretions
are made by the skin. The simple passage from
heat to cold, in suppressing sweat, and the pulmonary
exhalation, will change its composition. The same is
true of the other fluids; the state of the vital powers in
the organs, which are the sources of them, changes at
every moment; and therefore, the secreted substances,
which entirely depend upon the mode of action in the
organs, must be as various.</p>

<p>Who will venture to assert, that he knows the nature
of a fluid of the living economy if he has not analyzed it
in the infant, in the adult, and the aged, in the male and in
the female, at every season, during the calm of the mind,
and the storm of the passions, which so manifestly influence
its nature? To know such fluid perfectly, will it
not be requisite also to examine the different alterations
of which it is susceptible in consequence of disease?</p>

<p>The instability of the vital powers, is the quicksand on
which have sunk the calculations of all the Physicians of
the last hundred years. The habitual variations of the
living fluids, dependent on this instability, one would
think should be no less an obstacle to the analyzes of the
chemical physicians of the present age.</p>

<p>From this reasoning it is easy to perceive, that the
science of organized bodies should be treated in a very
different manner from that of inorganic bodies. To the
former a different language almost is requisite; for the
greater number of the words, which we transfer from the
physical sciences, into those of the animal or vegetable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
economy, incessantly recall ideas, which are by no means
consistent with their phenomena.</p>

<p>Had physiology been cultivated by men before physics,
I am persuaded that many applications of the former
would have been made to the latter; rivers would have
been seen to flow from the tonic action of their banks,
crystals to unite from the excitement, which they exercise
upon their reciprocal sensibilities, and planets to
move because they mutually irritate each other at vast
distances. All this would appear unreasonable to us, who
think of gravitation only in the consideration of these
phenomena; and why should we not in fact be as ridiculous
when we come with this same gravitation, with our
affinities and chemical compositions, and with a language
established upon their fundamental data to treat of a
science, with which they have nothing whatsoever to
do. Physiology would have made a much greater progress,
if all those who studied it, had set aside the notions
which are borrowed from the accessary sciences, as they
are termed. But these sciences are not accessary; they
are wholly strangers to physiology, and should be banished
from it wholly.<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>
<p>Physics and chemistry are related to each other in many
points, because the same laws in a variety of instances
preside over the phenomena of both of them; but an immense
interval divides them from the science of organic
bodies; because a very great difference exists between
the laws which are proper to them, and those of life. To
say that physiology is made up of the physics of animals,
is to give a very inaccurate idea of it; as well might we
say that astronomy is the physiology of the stars.</p>

<p>But the present digression has already been much too
long. We shall now consider the vital powers with
respect to the two lives of the animal.</p>


<h4>II. <em>Difference between the vital properties and those
of texture.</em></h4>

<p>In examining the properties of every living organ, we
may distinguish them into two kinds. Those of one
kind are dependent immediately upon life, begin and
finish with it, or rather form its principle and its essence.
Those of the other are connected with it only indirectly,
and appear rather to depend upon the organization and
texture of the parts of the body.</p>

<p>The faculties of perceiving and spontaneously contracting
are vital properties: extensibility, and the faculty of
contraction upon the cessation of the extending power,
are properties of texture; the latter it is true, are possessed
of a greater energy when existing in the living
fibre, but they remain with the organ when life has ceased;
the decomposition of the organs, is the term of their
existence. I shall first examine the vital properties.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span></p>


<h4>III. <em>Of the two kinds of sensibility; of the animal
and organic sensibilities.</em></h4>

<p>It is easy to perceive, that the vital properties can be
only those of perception and motion, but in the two lives
they possess a very different character. In the organic
life, sensibility is the faculty of receiving an impression;
in the animal life, it is the faculty of receiving an impression
and moreover of referring such impression to a common
centre.<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> The stomach is sensible to the presence
of aliments, the heart to the stimulus of the blood, the
excreting tube to the contact of the fluid, which is peculiar
to it; but the term of this sensibility is in the organ
itself. In the same way do the eyes, the membranes of
the nose and the mouth, the skin, and all the mucous
surfaces, at their origin, receive an impression from the
bodies which are in contact with them, but they afterwards
transmit such impression to the brain, which is the
general centre of the sensibility of these organs.</p>

<p>There is an animal sensibility then, and an organic
sensibility. Upon the one depend the phenomena of
digestion, circulation, secretion, exhalation, absorption,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
and nutrition. It is common to the plant, and the animal;
the Zoophyte enjoys it as perfectly as the most perfectly
organized quadruped. On the other depend sensation and
perception, as well as the pain and pleasure which modify
them. The perfection of animals, if I may so speak, is
in proportion to the quantity of this sensibility, which
has been bestowed upon them. This species of sensibility
is not the attribute of vegetable life.</p>

<p>The difference of these two kinds of sensitive power is
particularly well marked in the manner of their termination,
in the case of violent and sudden death. In such
case, the animal sensibility is at once extinguished; there
can no longer be found any trace of it at the moment
which succeeds to strong concussion of the brain, to great
hæmorrhage or asphyxia; but the organic sensibility
survives such accidents more or less. The lymphatics
continue to absorb, the muscle is still sensible to stimuli,
the nails and the hair continue to be nourished, and in
consequence are sensible of the fluids which they imbibe.<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
It is often a considerable time before all traces of this
sensibility are effaced; the annihilation of the other is
instantaneous.</p>

<p>Though at the first glance, the two sensibilities present
us so remarkable a difference, their nature nevertheless
appears to be essentially the same. The one perhaps is
only the maximum of the other, is the same force, but
according to its intensity is shown under different characters.
Of this the following observations are proofs.</p>

<p>There are different parts in the economy, where these
faculties are concatenated, and succeed each other insensibly.
The origin of all the mucous membranes is an
example of such parts. We have the sensation of the
passage of aliments in the mouth, and the back part of it;
this sensation becomes weaker at the beginning of the
œsophagus, decreases still towards its middle, and disappears
at its end, as well as in the stomach, where the
organic sensibility only remains. The same phenomena
may be observed in the urethra, &amp;c. In the neighbourhood
of the skin, the animal sensibility exists; it gradually
diminishes, however, and becomes organic in the interior
of the system.</p>

<p>Divers excitants applied to the same organ may alternately
produce the one, and the other mode of sensibility.
When irritated by acids, by very concentrated alkalies,
or by a cutting instrument, the ligaments do not transmit
to the brain the very strong impression which is made
upon them, but if they be twisted, distended or rent, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
lively sensation of pain is the result.<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> I have established
this fact by a number of experiments in my treatise on
the membranes. The following is another of the same
kind, which I have since observed. The parietes of the
arteries as we know are sensible to the blood by which
they are traversed, but at the same time are the term of
this sentiment. If a fluid, however, which is foreign to
this system, be injected into it, the animal will immediately
discover by his cries, that he is sensible of the
presence of such fluid.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>We have seen that it is a property of habit, to weaken
the sentiment, to transform into indifferent sensations all
those of pleasure, or of pain. Foreign bodies, for example,
will make upon the mucous membranes a painful impression
during the first days of their application to it; they
develop in such parts the animal sensibility, but by little
and little this sensibility decreases, and the organic alone
subsists. In this way the urethra is sensible of the bougie
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>as long as it continues there, for during the whole of such
time, the action of the mucous glands of the passage is
augmented, from whence arises a species of catarrh, but
the individual for the first moments only had a painful
consciousness of the presence of the instrument.</p>

<p>We every day observe, that inflammation in exalting
the organic sensibility of a part, transforms the organic
into the animal sensibility: the cartilages thus, and the
serous membranes which in their ordinary state have only
the obscure sentiment, which is necessary to their nutrition,
in an inflammatory state are possessed of an animal
sensibility, which is frequently stronger than that of
the organs to which it is natural. And why? Because
the essence of inflammation consists in accumulating the
powers of the part, and this accumulation suffices for
changing the mode of the organic sensibility, which
differs from the animal sensibility in quantity only.</p>

<p>From these considerations it is evident that the distinction
above established with respect to sensibility consists
in the different modifications of which this power is susceptible,
and not in its nature, which is every where the
same. This faculty is common to all the organs; they
are all of them possessed of it; it forms their true vital
character; but more or less abundantly distributed to
each, it gives to each a different mode of existence. No
two parts enjoy it in the same proportion. In these
varieties there is a degree, above which the brain is the
term of it, beneath which the organ alone is sensible of
the impression.</p>

<p>If to render my ideas on this head more clear I were to
use a vulgar expression, I should say that distributed in
such a dose to an organ, sensibility is animal: in such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
another dose, organic.<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>&mdash;Now that, which varies the dose
of sensibility, is sometimes the order of nature, (in which
way the skin and the nerves are more sensible than the
tendons, and cartilages;) at other times, disease; thus in
doubling the dose of sensibility to the cartilages inflammation
renders them equal in this respect, and even superior
to the former, and as a thousand causes may at every
moment exalt or diminish this power in any part of the
body it may be changed at every moment from the animal
to the organic type. Hence the reason, why authors,
who have made it the object of their experiments, have
come to results so different; and why some of them have
observed the periosteum and dura mater to be insensible,
while others have put them down on the contrary as
endowed with an extreme sensibility.</p>


<h4>IV. <em>Of the relation which exists between the sensibility
of each organ, and foreign bodies.</em></h4>

<p>Although the sensibility of each organ be subject to
continual variations, it is nevertheless distributed to each
by nature in a determined quantity; in a quantity to
which it ever returns after its alternations of augmentation
or decrease. In this respect it resembles the pendulum,
which in each of its different oscillations resumes the
place to which it is brought down by gravitation.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>
<p>It is this determined sum of sensibility, which especially
composes the life of each organ, and fixes the nature
of its relations with foreign bodies; in this way the
ordinary sum of sensibility in the urethra fits it for the
passage of the urine, but if this sum be augmented, as in
strong erection of the penis, the above relation ceases:
the canal refuses passage to the urine, and suffers itself to
be traversed by the semen only, which in its turn has no
relation with the sensibility of the urethra when the penis
is not erected.<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a></p>

<p>From hence proceeds the reason of the puckering up
and spasm of the parotid, the cystic, and pancreatic ducts,
as well as of the excreting tubes in general, when the
molecules of any other fluid than that, which they are
destined to convey are presented to them. The sum
of their sensibility corresponds exactly with the nature of
their respective fluids, but is disproportioned to that of
any other.<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>&mdash;The spasmodic contraction of the larynx
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>when irritated by any foreign body is produced in the
same manner; for the same reason the ducts, which open
upon the mucous surfaces, though at all times in contact
with a variety of different fluids, are never penetrated by
them.<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> The mouths of the lacteals, however patulous
within the alimentary canal, will take up the chyle only,
they reject the fluids, which are mixed with it; for with
these their sensibility has no relation.</p>

<p>Such relations do not exist only between the different
sensibility of the organs, and the different fluids of the
body; but they may be exercised also between exterior
substances, and the various parts of the living system.
The sum of sensibility in the bladder, the kidneys and
the salivary glands has a peculiar analogy with cantharides
and mercury. It might be thought that the sensibility
of each organ is modified, that it assumes a peculiar<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
nature, and that it is this diversity of nature, which
constitutes the difference of the relations of the organs
with regard to bodies in contact with them; but a number
of considerations tend to prove that such difference
is occasioned, not by any difference in the nature, but in
that of the sum, the dose, the quantity of the sensibility,
if such words may be applied to a living property. I
shall adduce the following instances:&mdash;</p>

<p>The absorbent orifices of the serous surfaces, are sometimes
bathed for months together in the fluid of dropsies,
and take up nothing. But if the sensibility of these
orifices be exalted by tonics, or an effort of nature, in
such case it will place itself, if I may so say, in equilibrium
with the fluid, and absorption will be made. The
resolution of tumours presents us with the same phenomena;
as long as the powers of the parts are weakened,
the lymphatics refuse admittance to the extravasated substances;
but if the sum of these powers be augmented by
the use of resolvents, in a short time, from the action of
the lymphatics, the tumour will disappear: from the same
cause the blood, and other fluids are taken up with a sort
of avidity at times, and at others, not at all.<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>The art of the physician, then, in the use of resolvents,
must consist in ascertaining the degree of sensibility<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
which he requires in the vessels for the purpose which
he has in view; and in exalting or depressing this power<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
accordingly. In this way, in different circumstances,
resolvents may be taken from the class of the debilitating
or stimulating remedies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>The whole of the theory of inflammation is connected
with the above ideas. It is well known that the system<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of the canals, which circulate the blood gives birth to a
number of other small vessels, which admit only the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
serous part of this fluid. Why do not the red globules
pass into the serous vessels, though there exist a continuity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span>
of canal? The cause by no means consists in the
disproportion of the vessels to the globules as Boerhaave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span>
has taught. The breadth of the white vessels might be
double or triple that of the red vessels, and still the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
globules of the latter colour would not pass into them, if
there were not to exist a relation between the sum of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span>
sensibility of the vessels, and the nature of the globules.
Neither will the chyme pass into the Choledochus, though
the diameter of this canal be very much larger, than that
of the attenuated molecules of the aliments. Now in the
healthy state, the quantity of sensibility in the white
vessels being inferior to that in the red ones, it is evident
that the relation necessary to the admission of the coloured
globules cannot exist. But if any cause should exalt
their powers, their sensibility will be on a par with that
of the latter set of vessels, and the passage of the fluids
till then refused, will take place with facility.</p>

<p>Hence it happens, that those surfaces, which are the
most exposed to such agents as exalt the sensibility, are
also the most subject to local inflammation, as may be
remarked in the conjunctiva and the lungs; at which
time such is usually the increase of sensibility in the
part, that of organic, which it was, it becomes animal,
and transmits to the brain the impressions, which are
made upon it.</p>

<p>Inflammation lasts as long as there subsists an excess
of sensibility; by degrees it diminishes, the red globules
cease to pass into the serous vessels and resolution takes
place.</p>

<p>From this it may be seen that the theory of inflammation
is only a natural consequence of the laws, which
preside over the passage of the fluids into their respective
tubes; hence also it may be easily conceived how
unfounded are all hypotheses, which are borrowed from
hydraulics, a science, which never can be really applied
to the animal œconomy, because there is no analogy
between a set of inert tubes, and a series of living ducts.<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>I should never have finished were I to enumerate the
consequences of this principle in the phenomena of the
living man. The reader will easily enlarge the field of
these consequences, the whole of them will form almost all
the great data of physiology, and the essential points of
the theory of diseases.</p>

<p>But no doubt it will be asked, why the organs of the
internal life have received from nature, an inferior degree
of sensibility only, and why they do not transmit to the
brain the impressions, which they receive, while all the
acts of the animal life imply this transmission? the reason
is simply this, that all the phenomena, which establish
our connexions with surrounding objects ought to be, and
are in fact under the influence of the will; while all those,
which serve for the purpose of assimilation only, escape,
and ought indeed to escape such influence. Now for a
phenomenon to depend upon the will, it is evidently
requisite that the individual be possessed of a consciousness
of such phenomenon, to be withdrawn from the
influence of the will, there should exist no such consciousness.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span></p>


<h4>V. <em>Of the two kinds of contractility, the animal, and
the organic contractility.</em></h4>

<p>Contraction is the ordinary medium, by which the
motion of the animal organs is effected; some parts,
however, move by dilating themselves, as the iris, the
corpora cavernosa, the teat and others; so that the two
general faculties, from whence spontaneous motion is
derived, are contractility and active extensibility; the
latter of these should be carefully distinguished from
passive extensibility, of which in a short time we shall
speak. The first is a property of life, the second a property
of texture; but as yet there exist too few data upon
the nature and mode of the motion resulting from the
former; it is exemplified in too small a number of organs,
for us to be enabled to pay much attention to it in these
general considerations&mdash;Accordingly we shall occupy
ourselves only upon the subject of contractility; with
respect to that of active extensibility, I refer to the
writings of the physicians of Montpellier.</p>

<p>Spontaneous motility, a faculty inherent in living
bodies, as well as sensibility, possesses two great modifications,
which differ very much from each other, accordingly
as it is examined in the phenomena of one or the
other life. There is an animal contractility, and there is
an organic contractility.</p>

<p>The one being essentially subject to the influence of
the will, has its principle in the brain, receives from the
brain the irradiations, which put it in action, and ceases
to exist when the organs, in which it is observed, communicate
no longer with the brain; it participates besides at
all times with the state of the brain, has exclusively its
seat in the voluntary muscles, and presides over locomotion,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
the voice, the general movements of the head, the
thorax and abdomen. The other, which is not dependent
on a common centre, has its principle in the moving
organ itself, is a stranger to the influence of volition, and
gives rise to the phenomena of digestion, circulation,
secretion, absorption, and nutrition.</p>

<p>The two are quite distinct in all cases of violent death;
such death annihilates at once the animal contractility,
and allows, for a longer or shorter time, the organic contractility
to be exercised; they are essentially distinct
also in all cases of asphyxia; in these, the first is entirely
suspended, the second remains in activity; lastly they
are distinct both in artificial palsy and in that which is
brought on by disease. In these, the voluntary motions
cease; the organic motions are unaltered.</p>

<p>Both the one and the other kind of contractility are
connected with their corresponding kinds of sensibility.
They are a consequence of them. The sensation of
external objects puts in action the animal contractility;
before the organic contractility of the heart can be exercised,
its organic sensibility must be excited by the influx
of blood.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the concatenation of these two kinds of
faculties is not always the same. The animal sensibility
may be exercised, and not be necessarily followed by the
exercise of its analogous contractility. There is a general
relation between sensation and locomotion, but this
relation is not direct and actual. On the contrary, the
organic contractility can never be separated from the sensibility
of the same species; the re-action of the excreting
tubes is immediately connected with the action, which
the secreted fluids exercise upon them: the contraction
of the heart must necessarily succeed the influx of the
blood into it. But authors have by no means separated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
these two things, either in their considerations or their
language. Irritability denotes at the same time the sensation
excited in the organ from the contact of bodies, and
the contraction of the organ in reacting upon its excitants.</p>

<p>The reason of this difference in the relation of the
two sensibilities and contractilities to each other is very
simple. In the organic life, there is nothing intermediate
in the exercise of these two faculties. The same organ is
the term, in which the sensation ends, and the principle
from whence the contraction begins. In the animal life,
on the contrary, there exists between these two acts two
intermediate functions, those of the brain namely, and
the nerves, and these by not being brought into action
may interrupt the relation in question.</p>

<p>To the same cause must we refer the following observation.
In the organic life there always exists a rigorous
proportion between the sensation, and the contraction.
In the animal life the one may be exalted or lowered,
and the other not affected by such change.</p>


<h4>VI. <em>Subdivision of the Organic contractility into two
Varieties.</em><a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a></h4>

<p>The animal contractility is always the same in whatever
part of the body it is situated. But there exist in the
organic contractility two essential modifications, which
would seem to indicate a difference in their nature, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
there be only diversity in outward appearances. This
difference is sometimes visible, at other times though
really existing, it cannot be seen by inspection.</p>

<p>The sensible organic contractility may be observed in
the heart, in the stomach, intestines, bladder,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
organs. It is exercised upon very considerable quantities
of the animal fluids.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span></p>

<p>The insensible organic contractility is that, by virtue
of which the excreting tubes re-act upon their respective<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
fluids, the secreting organs upon the blood, which flows
into them, the parts where nutrition is performed upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
the nutritive juices, and the lymphatics upon the substances
which excite their open extremities; upon all these<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
occasions, wherever the fluids are disseminated in small
quantities, or are very much divided, this second species
of contractility is brought into exercise. A tolerably<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
precise idea may be given of both, by comparing the one
with attraction, a power which is exercised upon the
great aggregate of matter, and the other with the chemical
affinities, the phenomena of which take place in the
molecules of different substances. For the purpose of
explaining this difference, Barthez has compared the one
to the second hand of a watch, which traverses the circumference
in a very apparent manner, and the other to
the hour hand, which moves also, but whose motion is
not distinguishable.</p>

<p>The sensible organic contractility nearly answers to the
irritability of authors; the insensible organic contractility
to what is called tonicity. But these words seem to suppose
in the properties, which they indicate a difference of
nature, while this difference exists only in appearance. I
therefore prefer employing for both a common term. It
designs their general character, that of appertaining to the
interior life, and their independence with regard to the
will. To this term I join an adjective expressive of
the particular attribute of each.</p>

<p>In fact we should possess a very inaccurate idea of
these two modes of action, were we to consider them as
proceeding from different principles. The one is but the
extreme of the other; they are both connected by insensible
gradations. Between the obscure but real contractility,
which is necessary to the nutrition of the nails,
and the hair, &amp;c. and that which we see in the motions
of the stomach, and intestines, there exist innumerable
shades of this property, which serve as transitions betwixt
its perceptible degrees; such are the motions of the
dartos,<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> of the arteries, and of certain parts of the cutaneous
organs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>The circulation will give us a very good idea of this
graduated enchainment of the two kinds of organic contractility.
The sensible organic contractility presides
over this function in the heart and large vessels,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
degrees it become less apparent, in proportion as the
diameter of the vascular system decreases; and lastly, it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
is insensible in the capillary tubes, where tonicity only
is observed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span></p>

<p>Should we consider irritability as a property inherent
exclusively in the muscles, as being one of the characters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>
by which they are distinguished from other organs, and
should we call this property by a name expressive of its
peculiar seat in the muscle, we should conceive it, if I
mistake not, in a very different way from that in which
it naturally exists.</p>

<p>It is true, that in this respect the muscles occupy the
first rank in the scale of the animal solids; they possess
the maximum of the organic contractility; but every
living organ acts, as they do, though in a manner less
apparent upon the excitant when artificially applied, or
on the fluid, which in the natural way is carried to it for
the purpose of supplying the matter of secretion, nutrition,
exhalation, or absorption.</p>

<p>Nothing in consequence is more uncertain than the
rule, which is commonly adopted for pronouncing upon
the muscularity of any doubtful part; for the rule consists
in ascertaining whether such part does or does not
contract under the action of stimuli.</p>

<p>It is thus, that a muscular tunic is admitted in the arteries,
although their organization entirely differs from that
of the muscles; it is thus, that the womb is pronounced
to be fleshy, however foreign to such structure; it is thus,
that a muscular texture is admitted in the dartos, in the
iris, and other parts, although no such structure be observable
there.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span></p>

<p>The faculty of contracting under the action of irritating
substances like that of the sensibility, is unequally distributed
among the organs; they enjoy it in different
degrees. We do not properly conceive it, if we suppose
that it belongs exclusively to some of them. It does not,
as some have imagined, possess its peculiar seat in the
muscular fibre. Life is the sole condition necessary to
all the fibres for enjoying it; their peculiar texture influences
the sum only, which they receive of it; it appears
that to such an organic texture, is attributed, if I may
so express myself, such a dose of contractility; to such
another texture, such another dose, and so on; so that to
employ the expressions, which I have used in treating on
the subject of sensibility (however improper they may
be, yet capable alone of rendering my ideas) the differences
in the organic contractility of our different parts,
consist in the quantity only, and not in the nature of this
property: indeed it is with respect to quantity only that
this property varies, accordingly as it is considered in
the muscles, the ligaments, the nerves, or the bones.</p>

<p>If a special mode of contraction ought to be designed
for the muscles by a particular expression, such expression
could be only derived from the property which they
have of contracting from the influence of the will; but
this property is foreign to their texture, and comes to
them from the brain only; for as soon as they cease to
communicate with this organ directly by means of the
nerves, they cease also to be the agents of voluntary motion.</p>

<p>These considerations lead us to examine the limits
which are placed between the one and the other kind of
contractility. We have seen that those which distinguish
the two modes of sensibility, appear to be derived only
from the greater or less proportion of this power; that in
a certain proportion sensibility is of the animal kind, in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
certain inferior proportion, of the organic kind, and that
frequently from an augmentation, or diminution of intensity
the two sensibilities reciprocally borrow their respective
characters. We have seen a phenomenon almost
analogous to this in the two subdivisions of the organic
contractility.</p>

<p>But this is not the case with regard to the two great
divisions of contractility considered in general. The
organic can never be transformed into the animal contractility.
Whatever be its increase of energy, it constantly
remains the same in its nature. The stomach, the intestines
frequently assume a susceptibility of contraction,
which makes them rise up and produces in them<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
most violent motions by the most simple stimuli, but these
movements preserve at all times their peculiar type, their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
primitive character; and have never been regulated by
the brain. From whence proceeds this difference in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span>
phenomena of sensibility and contractility? I cannot in
a precise and rigorous manner resolve this question.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>


<h4>VII. <em>Of the extensibility and contractility of texture.</em></h4>

<p>I shall now proceed to examine the properties, which
depend on texture only, on the organic arrangement of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
the fibres of the different parts. These are extensibility
and contractility.</p>

<p>They both succeed each other, and are connected in
the same way, as in the vital phenomena, the organic and
animal sensibilities are related to their respective contractilities.</p>

<p>Extensibility of texture, or the faculty of being distended
beyond the ordinary state by external impulse
(and in this it is distinguished from the extensibility of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
the iris,<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> the corpora cavernosa, &amp;c.) This extensibility,
I say, belongs to many organs. The extensor muscles
are very much lengthened in strong tension of the limbs;
the skin accommodates itself to tumours; the aponeuroses,
as we see in ascites and pregnancy, are distended
by what is accumulated beneath them. The mucous
membranes of the intestines, of the bladder; the serous
membranes of the greater number of the cavities present
us with similar phenomena, when these cavities are full.
The fibrous membranes, the bones themselves are susceptible
of distension. Thus in hydrocephalus the pericranium,
and the bones of the cranium, in spina ventosa and
other analogous diseases, the extremities or the middle
of the long bones experience a similar distension. The
kidneys, the brain, and the liver, when abscesses are
formed in their interior, the spleen and the lungs, when
penetrated by a great quantity of blood, the ligaments in
articular dropsies, in short all the organs, under a thousand
different circumstances, exemplify this property; a property
inherent in their texture, and not precisely depending
on their life; for as long as their texture remains
untouched, their extensibility subsists also, though they
themselves have ceased to live.&mdash;The decomposition of
the part, from whatever cause it happens, is the sole term<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
of this extensibility, in which the organs are passive at
all times, and subject to the mechanical influence of those
bodies which act upon them.</p>

<p>There exists for the different organs a scale of extensibility,
at the top of which are those which have the
greatest laxity in the arrangement of their fibres, as the
muscles, the skin, and cellular substance; at the bottom
of the scale are those which are characterized by their
density, as the bones, the cartilages, the tendons, and the
nails.</p>

<p>We must not, however, be deceived by appearances,
with regard to the extensibility of parts of the body; for
the serous membranes, which at the first glance would
seem to be capable of great distension, do not yield so
much of themselves, as from the development of their
folds. Thus the displacement of the skin, which abandons
certain parts, while it spreads over tumours in the
vicinity, might easily give rise to the supposition of its
being capable of a much greater distension than that of
which it is really susceptible.</p>

<p>With extensibility of texture, there corresponds a certain
mode of contractility, which may be designated by
the name of contractility of texture. This can only take
place after a previous distension.</p>

<p>In general the greater number of our organs are maintained
in a certain degree of tension from different causes;
the locomotive muscles by their antagonists, the hollow
muscles by the different substances which they enclose;
the vessels by the fluids, which circulate within them,
the skin of a part by that of the neighbouring parts, the
alveolar parietes by the teeth which they contain. If
these causes be removed, contraction supervenes; thus,
if a long muscle be cut, its antagonist will be shortened;
if a hollow muscle be emptied, it will contract; if an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
artery be deprived of its blood, it will become a ligament;
if the skin be cut into, the borders of the incision
will retire from each other; if a tooth be drawn, its cavity
will be obliterated.</p>

<p>In these cases it is the cessation of the natural extension,
which occasions the contraction; in other cases it is
the cessation of an unnatural extension which does so.
Thus, the lower belly is straitened after puncture or
delivery; the maxillary sinus, after the extirpation of a
fungus; the cellular texture, after the opening of an
abscess, the tunica vaginalis, after the operation of hydrocele,
the skin of the scrotum, after the extirpation of the
voluminous testicle, by which it was distended; the sac
of an aneurism, after the evacuation of the fluid.</p>

<p>This mode of contractility is not by any means dependent
on life; it belongs only to the texture, to the organic
arrangement of the part,<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> yet still receives from the vital
powers an increase of energy. Thus the retraction of a
muscle, which is cut in the dead subject, is much smaller
than that of a muscle divided in the living animal; in
the same way, the retraction of the skin varies; but
though less evident, this contractility subsists always,
and like its corresponding extensibility has no other limit
than that of the decomposition of the part.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span></p>

<p>The greater number of authors have confounded the
phenomena of this contractility with those of the insensible
organic contractility, or tonicity. Of these I might
reckon Haller, Blumenbach, Barthez and others, who
have referred to the same principle the return upon themselves
of the abdominal parietes, after distension, the
retraction of the skin, or a divided muscle, and the contraction
of the dartos from cold. The first of these
phenomena is owing to the contractility depending on
texture, which does not suppose the application of an
irritating substance; the second, to tonicity, which is
never exercised excepting when influenced by such application.</p>

<p>Neither have I myself, in my treatise on the membranes,
sufficiently distinguished these two modifications
of contraction, but we evidently ought to establish between
them the most decided limits.</p>

<p>An example will render this more sensible. Let us
take for it an organ, in which there may be observed
all the kinds of contractility, of which I have hitherto
spoken; a voluntary muscle for instance: In distinguishing
the species with precision we may acquire a clear and
precise idea of each of them.</p>

<p>Now such muscle may enter into action first by the
influence of the nerves, which it receives from the brain;
here it shews its animal contractility. Secondly, it may
be brought into action by the stimulus of a physical or
chemical agent applied to it, a stimulus, which artificially
creates a motion, analogous to that, which is natural to
the heart, and other involuntary muscles;&mdash;here we have
the sensible organic contractility or irritability. Thirdly,
its action may be produced by the influx of fluids, which
penetrate all its parts for the purpose of carrying thither
the matter of nutrition, and which at the same time are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
the occasion of a partial oscillatory movement in each
fibre, in each molecule, a movement as necessary to the
function of nutrition, as in the glands it is indispensable
to the process of secretion, or in the lymphatics to that
of absorption.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Such action we refer to the insensible
organic contractility or tonicity: Fourthly, by the transverse
section of the substance or body of the muscle,
may be determined the retraction of its two ends towards
their points of insertion. Here the contractility of its
texture is displayed.</p>

<p>Any one of these kinds of contractility may cease to
exist in a muscle and the others may not be affected.
Cut its nerves, and there will be no longer any animal
contractility; but the two modifications of its organic
contractility will continue to subsist. Impregnate the
muscle with opium, suffer its vessels to be well penetrated
with this substance and it will cease to contract
under the impression of stimuli, it will lose its irritability,
but it will continue to possess the tonic movements,
which are occasioned by the influx of blood into
it. Lastly, kill the animal, or rather let it live, but tie
the vessels which go to the limb, and the muscle will in
such case lose its tonic power and possess its contractility
of texture only. The latter will only cease on the supervention
of sphacelus.</p>

<p>By these examples the different kinds of contractility
may be appreciated with respect to the organs where they
are assembled in a smaller number than in the muscles of
volition; in the heart for instance and in the intestines,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
where there exists a sensible and insensible contractility,
the organic being retrenched; and again in the tendons,
aponeuroses, and bones, where the animal and sensible
organic contractilities are wanting, the insensible organic
and the contractility of texture only remaining.</p>

<p>In general these two last are inherent in every kind
of organ, the two first belonging to some in particular
only; hence for the general character of living parts
we must choose the insensible organic contractility or
tonicity, and for the character of all organized parts
whatsoever, whether living or dead, the contractility of
texture.<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a></p>

<p>We shall farther remark, that this last in the same way
as its corresponding extensibility possesses them, has its
different degrees, its scale of intensity, the skin and the
cellular substance on the one hand, the tendons, the aponeuroses,
and the bones on the other, forming the extremes
of this scale.</p>

<p>From all that has been said, it is easy to perceive, that
in the contractility of every organ there are two things
to be considered, namely the contractility, or the faculty,
and the cause, which puts it in action. The contractility
is always the same, belongs to the organ, is inherent in
it, but the cause which determines its exercise may be
various.</p>

<p>I have not inserted in this table that modification of
motion, which takes place in the iris, the corpora cavernosa,
&amp;c. a motion, which precedes the influx of the
blood, and which is not in such way occasioned, neither
have I mentioned the dilatation of the heart,<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and in a
word that species of active and vital excitability, of which
some parts appear to be susceptible, and my reason for
this neglect, although I recognise the reality of the modification,
is my want of clear and precise ideas on the
subject.</p>

<p>From the properties, which I have now explained, are
derived all the functions, all the phenomena, which are
exemplified in the living œconomy. There is not one,
which may not be traced to them after a strict analysis,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
in the same manner as in the phenomena of physics we
recur to the properties of attraction, elasticity, &amp;c.</p>

<p>Wherever the vital properties are in action, there is a
disengagement, and a loss of caloric peculiar to the animal,
which compose for him a temperature independent of the
medium in which he lives. The word caloricity will
hardly serve for the expression of this fact, which is a
general effect of the two great vital powers in a state of
action, and not produced by any especial faculty distinct
from them. We do not make use of the words, digestibility,
or respirability, because digestion and respiration
are the results of functions derived from the common
laws of the system.</p>

<p>For the same reason the digestive power of Grimaud
suggests an inaccurate idea. The assimilation of heterogeneous
substances to our organs, is not the effect of any
peculiar power. The same may be said of the different
principles admitted by a number of authors, who have
attributed to results and functions denominations expressive
of laws, and vital properties.</p>

<p>The proper life of each organ is composed of the different
modifications, to which are submitted in each of them
the vital sensibilities and mobilities, modifications, which
invariably are productive of others in the circulation and
temperature of the organ. Let it be noticed however,
that each organ independently of the general sensibility,
mobility, temperature, and circulation of the body, has
a particular mode of sensation and heat, together with a
capillary circulation, which being withdrawn from the
influence of the heart, receives the influence only of the
tonic action of the part.<a name="FNanchor_40_40" id="FNanchor_40_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> But we may pass over a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
point so frequently and sufficiently discussed by other
authors.</p>

<p>Let it here be understood that I offer what I have said
on the subject of the vital powers, only as a simple view
of the different modifications, which they experience in
the two lives. These detached ideas will in a short time
form the basis of a more extensive work.</p>

<p>Neither have I recapitulated the different divisions of
the vital powers, which have been adopted by authors;
the reader will find them in their works, and will easily
perceive the differences, which distinguish them from
those, which I have adopted. I shall only observe that
were these divisions clear and precise, did they suggest
to all the same meaning, we should not have to regret in
the writings of Haller, Lecat, Wyth, Haen, and all the
physicians of Montpellier, a number of disputes of no
importance to the interest of science, and surely fatiguing
to the student.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_18_18" id="Footnote_18_18"></a><a href="#FNanchor_18_18"><span class="label">[18]</span></a> Bichat often complains in his works of the injury that has been
done to the physiological sciences, by the attempts that are made to
facilitate the study of them by means of physics. He was not competent
to decide the question, not having sufficient data in the sciences,
the use of which he reprobated; the most that he should have said, was
that a bad application had been made of them. Even this reproach
was too general to be just. No doubt, mankind have been led into
errors by attempting to support on slight foundations a science which
was still in its infancy; but even in the time of Bichat it could not be
denied that it was to the progress of these same sciences, that was
owing the explanation of many very important phenomena; that by it
was ascertained what takes place in respiration, and by what means a
living body always supports itself between certain limits of temperature,
&amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_19_19" id="Footnote_19_19"></a><a href="#FNanchor_19_19"><span class="label">[19]</span></a> It must be remembered that the existence of such a sensibility is
purely conjectural. As it is not transmitted to a common centre, we
can recognize it only by its effects. In order to explain these effects,
there is no need of admitting a similar faculty. This sensibility moreover,
if its existence should be admitted, would be found continually
in fault. The stomach, for example, allows a substance to go out of
its cavity which could never serve for aliment, provided this substance
exhibits a degree of fluidity approaching that of chyme. The absorbents
take up the most noxious fluids, those even the action of which is
sufficiently powerful to destroy the organization of their parietes; the
heart contracts without the entrance of the blood into it, &amp;c.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_20_20" id="Footnote_20_20"></a><a href="#FNanchor_20_20"><span class="label">[20]</span></a> This is altogether inaccurate; a nail in growing is not nourished,
any more than the mucus is nourished in the nasal fossæ, or the urine
in the bladder. The nails, the hair on the various parts of the body
and the hair of the head, all in a word epidermoid productions, are the
result of real secretions which do not differ from the secretions of which
we have just spoken, only in this, that the product instead of remaining
fluid like the urine, or viscid like the mucus, hardens as it comes out
of the secretory organ, like the thread of the silk worm, or that of the
spider. A certain number of these organs is commonly arranged in
such a manner, that the matter secreted by each of them is found in a
fluid state in contact with that of the neighbouring organs, with which
it is agglomerated in hardening. Arranged in concentric circles around
a small cone, they produce a hollow cylinder; extended in parallel lines
upon a broad surface, they produce a flattened lamina. Such is the
manner in which the nails and the hair are formed. We see from this
that the epidermoid productions grow, but are not nourished. The
hair exhibits, it is true, an internal cavity, filled with a coloured fluid,
which appears to be necessary for its preservation; but we can easily
conceive how an oily fluid may help to preserve it, by giving it suppleness
and thus preventing it from breaking. This fluid is poured into
the canal in which it is found, and it is not the hair which draws it in, any
more at least, than a capillary tube draws in the fluid into which its
extremity is plunged.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_21_21" id="Footnote_21_21"></a><a href="#FNanchor_21_21"><span class="label">[21]</span></a> The idea of endowing each texture with a peculiar kind of sensibility
in relation with its uses is one which pleases the imagination.
The ligaments are designed to oppose the separation of the bones; they
should remain insensible to every kind of stimulus that does not tend
to disunite these parts, and pain consequently, should not be produced
but from distension or twisting. Unfortunately this supposition is not
well founded, the facts on which it rests were not accurately observed.
It is very true that in twisting these ligaments, the animal almost always
cries out, but it is because we at the same time stretch some neighbouring
parts endowed with sensibility. When this is prevented and the
experiment is made with proper precaution, we can twist, distend or
tear the ligament, without appearing to give the animal any pain.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_22_22" id="Footnote_22_22"></a><a href="#FNanchor_22_22"><span class="label">[22]</span></a> So, as long as the fluid is retained in the artery, which is easily done
by means of ligatures, no pain is manifested; but when the irritating
substance is carried by the vessels to the heart or to any other sensible
part, we can easily conceive that the animal must experience pain, for
the irritant always produces its effect, whether it be carried directly to
the part or arrive there by means of the circulation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_23_23" id="Footnote_23_23"></a><a href="#FNanchor_23_23"><span class="label">[23]</span></a> These expressions <em>dose</em>, <em>sum</em>, <em>quantity</em> of sensibility are incorrect,
inasmuch as they exhibit this vital faculty under the same point of view
as the physical forces, as attraction, for example; and as they present
it to us as susceptible of calculation, &amp;c.; but, from a want of words
for one science, it is necessary, in order to make it understood, to
borrow them from the other sciences. There are expressions, like the
words to <em>solder</em>, to <em>glue</em>, to <em>unglue</em>, &amp;c. that are used for the want of
others in the osseous system, and which really give very inaccurate
ideas, unless the mind corrects the sense.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_24_24" id="Footnote_24_24"></a><a href="#FNanchor_24_24"><span class="label">[24]</span></a> If the urine, during a perfect erection, does not go out of the
bladder, it is because the contraction of the muscles of the perineum,
and especially of the levator ani, prevents it. If these muscles are
relaxed, though the turgescence of the corpus cavernosum and of the
urethra remains the same, the urine flows out without any other obstacle
than what arises from the contraction of the canal produced by the
swelling of its parietes.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_25_25" id="Footnote_25_25"></a><a href="#FNanchor_25_25"><span class="label">[25]</span></a> These different excretory ducts do not exhibit in the mammalia
any contractility. There is no stimulus which can produce it in them;
I have tried them all in vain. In birds, on the contrary, the ureters
and the pancreatic and biliary canals are contractile, and their motions,
which return at intervals, are too well marked to be mistaken. It
appears that the contractility of the excretory canals in the abdomen,
is connected in these animals with the absence of the diaphragm. We
know in fact that this muscle in the mammalia, assists by the pressure
which it exerts, the course of the secreted fluids, and renders useless
the existence of a peculiar motion in the canals which contain them.
If it be however pretended that this motion exists in them, but that it
is insensible, it must be allowed then, that it cannot perform the office
which is attributed to it, viz. that of obliterating an opening often large
enough to admit a quill. It is true, that if the orifice of one of these
canals be irritated for a long time, a swelling of the membrane which
lines it is sometimes produced, and the opening is then really lessened.
But in these cases there is no occasion to be deceived; we see that this
swelling is produced at that point by the afflux of the fluids, as it would
be in any other part subjected to a similar excitement. Besides, it
should be observed that the obliquity of insertion of the excretory
ducts is alone sufficient to explain how the substances which pass in
front of their orifices are not introduced into them. In fact these
substances, at the moment of their passage, by the pressure which they
exert, tend to obliterate the opening of the canal, by flattening its
parietes against each other; it is thus that the pressure of the urine,
upon the inferior extremity of the ureters, prevents this fluid from
ascending towards the kidney. The obliteration of the opening is but
an accidental thing, and most often is not even complete.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_26_26" id="Footnote_26_26"></a><a href="#FNanchor_26_26"><span class="label">[26]</span></a> It is not surprising, that a canal usually filled with the excreted
fluids should refuse to admit another which runs in an opposite direction.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_27_27" id="Footnote_27_27"></a><a href="#FNanchor_27_27"><span class="label">[27]</span></a> All that is here said of the sensibility of the lymphatic vessels, which
makes them sometimes admit and sometimes reject the effused fluids, is
the more hypothetical, as it is not as yet proved that these vessels are
the agents of absorption. It should be remarked, that the fluids that
are supposed to be absorbed by them, differ essentially in their chemical
composition, from the fluid that is usually found in their cavity. This
fluid besides varies but very little in its composition, though its appearance
is not uniformly the same; now, if it were the result of the
absorption of fluids differing from each other, its composition ought
also to vary as that of the chyle does, according to the nature of the
aliments.
</p>
<p>
Before the lymphatic vessels were known, the principal phenomena
of absorption were observed, and it was natural to attribute them to
the action of the veins. This opinion was maintained for a long time
after the discovery of the lymphatics. Finally, towards the middle of
the last century, Hunter being engaged in examining these vessels,
which he has done more to make known than any other man, thought
that they should be considered as the agents of absorption, and this
opinion was soon generally admitted. If we look for the means by
which he overthrew the ancient theory, we are astonished to find that it
was by five experiments only. Harvey did not with equal facility obtain
the acknowledgment of the circulation, and perhaps there does not
exist a second example of an opinion, which was for a long time
established, being abandoned so readily. It should be remarked, that
physiologists had not yet recovered from the surprise produced by the
discovery of a system of vessels so extensive, and yet for so long a
time unknown; they were impatient to know the use of them; the
veins had already the function of returning to the heart the blood
brought by the arteries; they thought it would not impoverish them
too much to deprive them of the faculty of absorbing, in order to enrich
the lymphatics with it. Of the five experiments of Hunter, two are
designed to prove that the veins do not absorb, the object of the other
three is to show that the lymphatics do.
</p>
<p>
In the first experiment he injected tepid water into a portion of intestine,
and the blood which returned by the vein appeared to be neither
more diluted nor lighter than before. We cannot conceive how by
mere inspection, it is possible to judge if the blood contains a certain
quantity of absorbed water, a quantity which must be proportionably
very small, if we consider the whole amount of blood that passes
through the mesentric veins during the period necessary for the absorption
of the fluid. Hunter in the same experiment tied the artery which
went to the portion of intestine, and examined the state of the vein.
It did not swell, and its blood did not become aqueous. But after this
ligature, did the absorption continue to go on in this portion of intestine,
which still had no doubt lymphatic vessels? This the author does not
say. How moreover should he think that the vein could continue its
action when the artery was tied?
</p>
<p>
In the second experiment Hunter injected milk into a portion of
intestine, and was unable to discover this fluid in the blood of the
mesentric veins; but at the period in which this experiment was made,
mankind were very far from being able to detect in the blood a very
small quantity of milk, and at the present day, with all the aid derived
from chemistry, we can hardly discover in it a small quantity which is
mixed directly with it. These two experiments prove then nothing
against the absorption of the veins; as to those which he brings forward
in favour of absorption by the lymphatics, they are not more conclusive.
I shall content myself with relating one of them. He injected,
into a portion of intestine that was empty, a certain quantity of warm
milk, and confined it there by two ligatures. The veins that came
from this portion were emptied of their blood by several punctures
made in their trunk. The corresponding arteries were tied. He then
returned the parts into the abdomen, and drew them out again in half
an hour. Having examined them with attention, he observed that the
veins were almost empty, and that they contained no white fluid, whilst
the lacteals were almost full of it. But was not this white fluid that
filled them chyle rather than milk? Was it not there before the
injection of this liquid? In order to ascertain what takes place in the
lymphatic vessels during absorption, we must begin by examining the
state of these vessels before the experiment. But this is what Hunter
did not do, and it is this that renders his experiment of no value. It is
not very astonishing that he mistook the chyle for the milk, since milk
has for a long time been mistaken for chyle. Flandrin, Professor of
the Veterinary School at Alfort, has several times repeated this experiment
of Hunter; but he took care before the injection of the milk to
ascertain that the lymphatics contained no white fluid; and he never
found any in their cavity after the experiment. I have myself many
times performed this experiment, with the same precaution, and I have
uniformly obtained the same results as those of Flandrin.
</p>
<p>
It would occupy too much time to examine all the reasons that have
been advanced for and against the absorption of the lymphatics; I shall
only relate some experiments I have made myself; but I ought first to
observe, that absorption undoubtedly takes place in parts such as the
eye, the brain, and the placenta in which the most minute dissection
has been unable to discover any lymphatic vessel.
</p>
<p>
<em>First experiment.</em>&mdash;Four ounces of the decoction of rhubarb was
given to a dog, in half an hour after he was killed, and it was found that
more than half of the liquid had disappeared; the urine evidently contained
rhubarb, but the lymph in the thoracic duct exhibited no trace of it.
</p>
<p>
<em>Second experiment.</em>&mdash;A dog swallowed several ounces of alcohol
diluted with water; at the end of a quarter of an hour, the blood of
the animal had a very distinct odour of alcohol, but there was nothing
of the kind in the lymph.
</p>
<p>
Flandrin made a similar experiment on a horse, to whom he gave
half a pound of assafetida mixed with an equal quantity of honey.
Six hours after, the horse was killed. The odour of the assafetida was
very perceptible in the blood of the veins of the stomach, of the small
intestines and the cœcum; but it could not be perceived in the
lymph.
</p>
<p>
<em>Third experiment.</em>&mdash;A dog was made to swallow six ounces of a
solution of Prussiate of Potash in water. In a quarter of an hour, the
urine very evidently contained some of the Prussiate; but the lymph
taken from the thoracic duct showed no appearance of it.
</p>
<p>
<em>Fourth experiment.</em>&mdash;I gave to a dog, in whom I had tied the thoracic
duct, two ounces of a decoction of nux vomica. The effects of absorption
were as rapid as if the duct had been open. After the death of the
animal I satisfied myself, that the duct had been well tied, and that
there was no other branch, as there sometimes is, by which the lymph
could get to the subclavian vein.
</p>
<p>
I have varied this experiment by putting the poisonous fluid, into the
rectum, the sacs of the pleura and peritoneum. The results have been
uniformly the same.
</p>
<p>
<em>Fifth experiment.</em>&mdash;M. Delille and myself made an incision into the
abdominal parietes of a dog, who had been fed very heartily some hours
before, so that the lacteals might be easily seen, and we then drew out
a portion of the small intestine upon which we applied two ligatures
three inches from each other. The lymphatics that went from this
portion of intestine were full of chyle and very distinct. They were
all tied and cut. The blood vessels were also tied and cut, with the
exception of an artery and a vein; the portion of intestine also was
cut off beyond the ligatures, and thus it had no communication with
the rest of the animal except by the vein and artery which were left.
These two vessels were dissected with the greatest care, and even
stripped of their cellular coat, lest there might be some lymphatics
concealed in it; we then injected into the cavity of this portion of
intestine a decoction of nux vomica, and we retained it there by means
of a new ligature. This portion of intestine, covered with fine linen,
was restored to the abdomen; six minutes after, the effects of the poison
were manifested with their usual intensity.
</p>
<p>
<em>Sixth experiment.</em>&mdash;M. Delille and myself separated the thigh of a
dog from his body, leaving only the crural artery and vein, which kept
up the communication between the two parts. These two vessels were
dissected with care, insulated to an extent of from two to three inches,
and even stripped of their cellular coat, for fear it might conceal some
small lymphatic vessel. Two grains of a very active poison (the upas)
were then inserted into the paw, and the effects were as sudden and as
intense as if the thigh had not been separated from the body.
</p>
<p>
As it might be objected, that notwithstanding all the precautions
taken, the parietes of the artery or vein might still contain some
lymphatic, we varied our experiment so as to leave no doubt on this
point. The artery was cut entirely off, the communication was reestablished
between the two ends, by means of a leaden tube introduced
into their cavity, and fixed by proper ligatures. The same was done
for the vein. Thus there was no longer any communication between
the thigh and the rest of the body, except by the arterial blood which
came to the thigh, and by the venous blood which returned to the
trunk: the poison afterwards introduced into the paw produced its
effects in the ordinary time, that is in about four minutes.
</p>
<p>
From these different experiments, it is right to conclude that the
minute branches of the veins possess the power of absorbing; that
they exert it on the surface of the mucous and serous membranes, and
in the interior of the organs; that the experiments that have been
quoted in favour of the absorption of the lymphatics are inaccurate or
incorrectly understood, and finally that there is no proof that these
vessels absorb any thing but chyle.
</p>
<p>
Is it now necessary to refer to the venous branches this sensibility that
has been attributed to the ultimate ramifications of the lymphatics? But
this sensibility, as we have already said, would be constantly in error;
the absorbent vessel does not select one fluid in preference to another;
all are indiscriminately absorbed, even the most irritating, those in fact
whose action is sufficiently powerful to destroy the vascular parietes.
Besides, the phenomenon then continues, when it is no longer possible
to suppose the existence of this sensibility. After death even, the
venous branches absorb still as they do during life, if they are placed in
analogous circumstances; and to do this it is evident, that an internal
current must be established, which resembles the course of the blood.
I shall now relate an experiment, which I made on this subject, and
which I selected from many others, because it appeared to me to be
very conclusive.
</p>
<p>
I took the heart of a dog that had died the day before; I injected
into one of the coronary arteries some water of the temperature of 30
degrees of the centigrade thermometer. This water returned easily by
the coronary vein to the right auricle, whence it flowed into a vessel or
dish. I poured half an ounce of slightly acid water into the pericardium.
At first the injected water exhibited no sign of acidity; but in
five or six minutes it presented unequivocal marks of it.
</p>
<p>
Absorption then can take place without the assistance of this sensibility,
as well as of this insensible organic mobility, which is supposed
to be in the ultimate vascular extremities, in the absorbing mouths, as
they are called. But do these mouths really exist? Do the last capillary
branches terminate abruptly with a large opening on the surface of
the membranes or in the texture of the organs? Can the absorbed
fluids pass through their parietes as oxygen does in the lungs to arrive
at the blood which it modifies? We are unable to make experiments on
these small vessels, that are not cognizable by our senses; let us make
them on the large ones, and if they permit fluids, in which they are
immersed, to pass through them, for a stronger reason we may suppose
that it takes place in the capillaries, whose parietes are so much more
delicate and consequently more permeable. Now we have confirmed
by experiments what we had suspected; the first attempts were made
on dead vessels.
</p>
<p>
I took a portion of the external jugular vein of a dog; I stripped it
of the surrounding cellular texture; I attached to each of its extremities
a glass tube by means of which I established a current of warm
water through its interior; I then immersed the vein into a liquor
slightly acid.
</p>
<p>
It is seen by the arrangement of the apparatus that there could not
be any communication between the internal current of warm water
and the external acid liquor.
</p>
<p>
During the first minutes the liquid that I collected did not change its
nature; but after five or six minutes the water became perceptibly
acid; absorption had taken place.
</p>
<p>
The same experiment was repeated on veins taken from human
subjects; the effect was the same; it was the same also with the
arteries, but a little slower from the greater thickness of their coats.
</p>
<p>
It remained to be seen if in a living animal absorption thus took place
through the parietes of a large vessel. I know that the textures that
were permeable after death, are almost all so during life, though the
contrary is generally believed. If we inject into the pleura of a living
animal a certain quantity of ink, at the end of an hour, and often
sooner, we shall find the pleura, the pericardium, the intercostal
muscles, and the surface of the heart itself, evidently of a black colour.
It is true that the signs of this exudation are not always apparent.
Thus after death, the transudation of the gall bladder is rendered
evident by the colouring of the neighbouring parts. During life, on
the contrary, as fast as the colouring particles are deposited, they are
absorbed by the serous membrane which covers the surrounding parts,
and carried off by the sanguineous current which runs through this
membrane and the subjacent organs.
</p>
<p>
From these considerations we must believe that absorption may take
place through the parietes of the vessel during life as after death. To
be satisfied of this I made the following experiment:
</p>
<p>
I took a young dog of about six weeks old. At this age the vascular
parietes are delicate, and consequently more likely to render the experiment
successful. I laid bare one of the jugular veins; I insulated it
perfectly in its whole length; I stripped off carefully every thing which
covered it, and especially the cellular texture and some small vessels
that ramified on it; I placed it on a card, that it might not be in contact
with the surrounding parts; I then let fall, on its surface and
opposite the middle of the card, a thick aqueous solution of an alcoholic
extract of nux vomica, a substance the action of which is very powerful
on dogs; I took care that none of the poison could touch any thing
but the vein and the card, and that the course of blood was free in the
interior of the vessel. Before the fourth minute, the effects that I
expected appeared, at first feeble, but afterwards with so much power
as to render inflation of the lungs necessary to prevent the death of the
animal. I repeated this experiment on an adult animal of a much
larger size than the preceding one; the same effects appeared but
slower, on account of the greater thickness of the parietes; they began
to appear in fact after the tenth minute.
</p>
<p>
After satisfying myself with this result respecting the veins, I thought
I would ascertain if the arteries exhibited analogous properties. These
vessels are in a less favourable condition; their texture is less spongy
than that of the veins and with an equal caliber, their parietes are much
thicker. It was easy then to foresee, that if the phenomenon of absorption
showed itself, it would appear much slower than in the veins; this
was confirmed in an experiment on two large rabbits, in whom I dissected
perfectly clean one of the carotid arteries. It was more than a
quarter of an hour before the solution of nux vomica passed through
the parietes of the artery. As soon as I saw the symptoms of poisoning
distinctly, I stopped moistening the vessel; yet one of the rabbits died.
In order then to convince myself that the poison had really passed
through the arterial parietes, and that it had not been absorbed by
small veins which might have escaped my dissection, I carefully detached
the vessel that had been used in the experiment; I cut it open in
its whole extent, and I made those who assisted me taste a little of the
blood, that was still adhering to the internal surface; they all perceived
in it, and I did myself, the extreme bitterness of the extract of the nux
vomica.
</p>
<p>
To these experiments may be objected a fact that is observed, which
is, that absorption does not take place the same under all circumstances;
its activity is redoubled or diminished, according to the state
of some other functions. Thus during a paroxysm of fever, a medicine,
which would usually act with great effect, often produces, when given
in a double or treble dose, no perceptible effect. Now if absorption,
was a purely mechanical phenomenon, would it undergo modifications
in relation with those of the vital functions? Without doubt it would;
for these modifications of the functions may introduce new physical
circumstances favourable or injurious to the production of a mechanical
phenomenon. Thus in the present case, the state of fever, by accelerating
the circulation distends with blood the arteries and the veins.
The fluid that is to be absorbed must pass from the exterior to the
interior of these vessels. Now it may be easily conceived, that the
quantity of blood which they contain must have a great influence upon
the production of the phenomenon by the greater or less degree of
tension of their parietes. This is moreover completely confirmed by
experiment.
</p>
<p>
We can, without producing a very great disturbance in the functions,
increase at pleasure the quantity of fluid which passes through the
blood-vessels, by carefully injecting into the veins water the temperature
of which is near that of the blood. An artificial plethora is thus
produced, followed by very curious phenomena, of which I shall have
occasion hereafter to speak. One day while making this experiment,
the idea occurred to me of seeing what influence the plethora thus produced
would exert upon the phenomenon of absorption.
</p>
<p>
In consequence, after having injected into the veins of a dog of
middle size about a quart of water, I placed in the pleura a small dose
of a substance, the effects of which were well known to me. These
effects did not show themselves till many minutes after the period in
which they usually appear. I soon made the same experiment on
another animal with the same result.
</p>
<p>
In many other trials the effects showed themselves at the period in
which they ought to have appeared; but they were evidently weaker
and prolonged much beyond the ordinary time.
</p>
<p>
Finally, in another experiment in which I had introduced as much
water as the animal could bear and live, the effects did not appear at
all. I waited nearly half an hour for effects which commonly show
themselves in two or three minutes. Presuming then that the distension
of the vessels prevented the absorption, I endeavoured to satisfy
myself of it, by seeing if after the distension had ceased, absorption
would be any longer prevented. In consequence, I bled the animal
copiously from the jugular, and I saw, with the greatest satisfaction,
the effects appearing as the blood flowed out.
</p>
<p>
It was proper to make the opposite experiment, that is to say to
diminish the quantity of blood, in order to see if absorption would take
place sooner. This took place in fact, as I thought it would; about
half a pound of blood was taken from an animal; the effects, which
did not usually appear till after the second minute, showed themselves
in thirty seconds.
</p>
<p>
Yet it might still be suspected, that it was less the distension of the
blood-vessels than the change of the nature of the blood that opposed
absorption. To remove this difficulty I made the following experiment;
a dog was bled copiously; the place of the blood which he had lost
was supplied by water at the temperature of 40 degrees of the centigrade
thermometer, and a certain quantity of a solution of nux vomica
was introduced into the pleura. The consequences of it were as
prompt and as powerful, as if the nature of the blood had not been
changed; it was then to the distension of the vessels that must be
attributed the want or diminution of absorption.
</p>
<p>
The consequences that may be deduced from the experiments I have
just related will acquire new force, if we connect with these facts a
multitude of pathological ones, which are every day seen; such as the
cure of dropsies, engorgements and inflammations by bleeding; the
evident want of action of medicines at the moment of a violent fever,
when the vascular system is powerfully distended; the practice of
certain physicians who purge and bleed their patients before administering
active medicines to them; the employment of cinchona at the period
of remission for the cure of intermittent fevers; general or partial oedema
from organic disease of the heart or lungs, and the application of a ligature
upon the extremities after a puncture or a bite of a venomous animal,
to prevent the deleterious effects which are the consequence of it.
</p>
<p>
On the whole, I think, it may be concluded from the preceding
experiments that the capillary attraction of the small vessels is one of
the principal causes of the absorption called venous. If the lymphatics
do not appear to enjoy in the same manner the faculty of absorption,
it probably arises not from the nature of the parietes, the physical
properties of which are nearly the same as those of the veins, but from
the want of a continuous current in their interior.
</p>
<p>
In this note I have brought together the absorption of the gases and
that of fluids. This resemblance holds only as it relates to the permeability
of the textures by these two orders of bodies. As to the cause
of the absorption of the two, it cannot be the same, since gases are
not subjected to capillary attraction.<a name="FNanchor_28_28" id="FNanchor_28_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p></div>

note M. Magendie has not done justice to Mr. Hunter. Without entering
at all into the examination of the question, whether absorption is
performed by the lymphatics or the veins, it is due to Mr. Hunter to
contradict the assertion, that “he overthrew the ancient theory by <em>five
experiments only</em>.” He was not a man who adopted his opinions
loosely or on slight grounds, and in the present case he performed
between twenty and thirty judicious and satisfactory experiments, in
the presence of several physicians and surgeons. It is true that these
were performed on five different animals only, but if the result were
uniform, this number was as good as five thousand or any other one that
could be named.

from hydraulics, and probably will be so for a long time; but it arises
from this, that the science on which it is founded, hydrodynamics, is still
but little advanced. A great advance will unquestionably be made in
physiology, when we shall arrive at a knowledge of the course of a fluid
in a system of canals, which have the same physical conditions as the
system of arterial and venous vessels. But it will be a long time before
science will have arrived at that point. Is it necessary for this to make
no use, in the explanation of the circulation, of the few facts which are
known upon the course of the fluids? Is it necessary to enter entirely
into the field of hypothesis, to suppose in the small vessels a sensibility
and a contractility which evidently do not exist in the large ones? I
cannot believe it, and I think even that if this hypothesis should be
true, and if there should be demonstrated for the capillary vessels,
those properties which are attributed to them, and which would have
an influence on the course of the blood, we should then know but one
of the conditions of this very complicated problem, and this would not
in any degree do away the necessity of knowing all the mechanical
conditions.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_30_30" id="Footnote_30_30"></a><a href="#FNanchor_30_30"><span class="label">[30]</span></a> Even in reasoning according to the hypothesis of Bichat, and
admitting the existence of this organic sensibility, it would always be
inaccurate to say, that the contraction is uniformly in proportion to the
sensation. How is it to be known in fact? Since this sensibility is not
transmitted to a common centre, it might very well be excited without
our being informed of it by any apparent effect. Sometimes also a
very evident contraction would correspond to the slightest excitement.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_31_31" id="Footnote_31_31"></a><a href="#FNanchor_31_31"><span class="label">[31]</span></a> The contractility in the different organs in which we can observe
it does not exhibit characters so striking as those which Bichat here
assigns to it, and the motions which he ranks in the same class have
the greatest differences among them. To be convinced how little
justice there is in this division, it will be sufficient to trace the progress
of the food, along its whole course, to the interior of the digestive
canal. The first act which is presented to our observation is entirely
voluntary; this is mastication; the act which follows it is not so completely
so. Deglutition in fact can sometimes take place against the
will, if a body of a proper consistence is at the entrance of the pharynx.
We have but an imperfect control over the muscles of the uvula and
the velum palati, if we wish to move these parts separately; we have
perhaps less power still over the contraction of the muscles of the
pharynx, though they do not appear to differ from the locomotive
muscles, either in their symmetry, or in the arrangement and colour of
their fibres, or in the nerves which they receive; nor finally do they
differ in the sudden, instantaneous contraction, wholly different from
the slow contraction, the vermicular motion of the stomach and intestines.
</p>
<p>
After having passed the pharynx, the alimentary mass enters the
œsophagus. The motions are there still under the influence of the
nerves; but they are not at all under the influence of the will. The
muscular layer which produces them has not the appearance, the red
colour of the voluntary muscles; but it still preserves something of
the sudden motion of their contraction. Hence we see, that the
motions of the œsophagus cannot be ranked either among the motions
of organic life, since they cease by the division of the nerves, or among
those of animal life, as they are not under the influence of the will. It
is remarkable also that Bichat, who, in this and the following paragraph,
announces the characters of the different kinds of contractility, does
not speak of the œsophagus, whilst he offers as an example the motions
of the bladder, the heart, the stomach and the intestines.
</p>
<p>
When Bichat wrote this work, hardly any thing of the motions of
the œsophagus was known, except from the writings of Haller, who
made but four experiments on the subject. I wished to observe them
myself, and I have discovered many facts which I think interesting; I
shall relate them here as I described them in a memoir read to the
Institute in 1813. Before attempting to ascertain what part the œsophagus
took in the passage of the food, it was proper to ascertain its
state when it was supposed to be at rest. In the first experiments, I
noticed an important phenomenon, and which hitherto had escaped the
observation of physiologists, viz., that the lower third of the œsophagus
has constantly an alternate motion of contraction and relaxation, which
appears to be independent of all foreign irritation. This motion appears
to be confined to the portion of the tube which is surrounded by the
plexus of nerves of the eighth pair, that is to say, to about its lower third;
there is no trace of it in the neck nor in the superior part of the thorax.
The contraction appears like a peristaltic motion, it begins at the junction
of the superior two thirds with the inferior third, and is continued
to the insertion of this tube in the stomach. When the contraction is
once produced, it continues for an uncertain time; usually it is less
than half an hour. The œsophagus contracted in this way in its lower
third is hard like a cord powerfully stretched. Some persons whom I
have made feel of it in this state have compared it to a rod. When
the contraction has lasted the time I have just mentioned, the relaxation
takes place suddenly and simultaneously in each of the contracted
fibres; in some cases, however, the relaxation seems to take place from
the superior fibres towards the inferior ones. The œsophagus examined
during the state of relaxation exhibits a remarkable flaccidity, which
contrasts wonderfully with the state of contraction.
</p>
<p>
This alternate motion is dependent on the nerves of the eighth pair.
When these nerves are cut in an animal, this motion entirely ceases;
the œsophagus contracts no more, but it is not in a state of relaxation;
its fibres without the control of nervous influence shorten; it is this
which produces, so far as the touch is concerned, an intermediate state
between contraction and relaxation.
</p>
<p>
When the stomach is empty or half full of food, the contraction of
the œsophagus recurs at much longer intervals; but if the stomach be
powerfully distended by any cause, the contraction of the œsophagus
is usually very powerful, and continues for a much longer time. I have
seen it, in cases of this kind, continue more than ten minutes; under
the same circumstances, that is to say, when the stomach is excessively
full, the relaxation is always much shorter.
</p>
<p>
If during the time of contraction, we wished, by mechanical pressure
made on the stomach, to make a part of the aliments which it contained
pass into the œsophagus, it would be necessary, in order to accomplish
it, to employ a very considerable force; and often even we should not
succeed. It seems that pressure increases the intensity of the contraction,
and prolongs its duration. If, on the contrary, the stomach is
pressed during relaxation, it is very easy to make the substances it
contains pass into the cavity of the œsophagus. If it be a liquid, the
slightest pressure, sometimes even its own weight, or the tendency
which the stomach itself has to contract, will bring about this result.
When the stomach is laid bare and distended above measure, fluid does
not usually enter into the œsophagus, because, as we have said, the distension
of the stomach is a cause which prolongs the contraction of the
œsophagus.
</p>
<p>
The passage of a fluid in the œsophagus is usually followed by its
entrance into the stomach. Sometimes however the fluid is thrown out.
When it goes into the stomach, the œsophagus contracts nearly the
same as in deglutition, sometimes almost immediately after it has entered
it; at other times the œsophagus allows itself to be considerably distended
before it pushes it into the stomach.
</p>
<p>
It was at the moment of deglutition that Haller observed the motions
of the œsophagus, and the description which he has given of them is
very accurate for the two superior thirds of the canal; but the action
of the inferior third is essentially different; and this distinction seems
to have escaped him. Haller says that the relaxation of each circular
fibre immediately follows the contraction; and this is true of the portion
of the canal situated in the neck and in the superior part of the
thorax; but it is not accurate for the inferior portion, in which we see
that the contraction of all the circular fibres is continued long after
the entrance of solids or fluids into the stomach. At this moment the
mucous membrane of the cardiac extremity of the œsophagus, pushed
by the contraction of the circular fibres, forms a very considerable
projection into the cavity of the stomach. The contraction usually
coincides with the period of inspiration, when the stomach is more
strongly compressed; the relaxation takes place most often at the time
of expiration. When the aliments have once entered the stomach, it
is this contraction of the inferior part of the œsophagus which opposes
their return. The resistance that is offered at the other orifice is not
of the same species. In living animals, whether the stomach be empty
or full, the pylorus is uniformly shut by the contraction of its fibrous
ring and the contraction of its circular fibres. There is frequently seen
in the stomach another contraction, at one or two inches distance,
which appears to be designed to prevent the aliments from arriving
at the pylorus. We perceive also irregular contractions, beginning at
the duodenum, and extending to the pyloric portion of the stomach,
the effect of which is to push back the aliments towards the splenic
part.
</p>
<p>
The aliments remain in the stomach long enough to undergo no
other modifications than those which result from their mixture with the
perspiratory and mucous fluids, which are constantly found in it and
renewed there. During this time the stomach remains uniformly distended;
but afterwards the pyloric portion contracts in its whole
extent, especially in the part nearest the splenic portion, towards which
the aliments are carried. Then there is found, in the pyloric portion,
only the chyle mixed with some unchanged aliments. When there is
accumulated in this part a quantity of it, which is never very considerable,
there is seen, after a moment of rest, a contraction at the extremity
of the duodenum; the pylorus and the pyloric portion soon take part
in this motion, and the chyle is forced towards the splenic portion; but
afterwards the motion is in an inverse direction. The pyloric portion,
which allowed itself to be distended, contracts from left to right, and
directs the chyle towards the duodenum, which soon passes the pylorus
and enters the intestine. The same phenomenon is repeated a certain
number of times, then it ceases, and commences again after some time.
This motion, when the stomach contains much food, is limited to that
part of the organ nearest the pylorus; but as it becomes empty, the
motion extends, and appears even in the splenic portion when the
stomach is almost entirely evacuated. In general, it becomes more
evident at the end of chylification.
</p>
<p>
The motion which produces the progression of the chyle in the small
intestines is very analogous to that of the pylorus; it is irregular, made
at variable intervals, it is sometimes in one direction and sometimes in
another, and sometimes appears in many parts at once; it is always
more or less slow, it produces changes of relations in the intestinal
circumvolutions, and it is entirely beyond the influence of the will.
</p>
<p>
We should form a very false idea of the motions of the small intestines
during digestion, if we judged of them by those which these
intestines exhibit in an animal recently killed. In this case, it is not
the annular fibres only that enter into action, so as to exhibit, by their
successive contractions, a vermicular motion. The longitudinal fibres
act also in a very conspicuous manner, and produce a rolling of the
intestinal circumvolutions, which change their relations at every instant.
These motions are never more evident than when the whole mass of
intestines is removed from a living animal.
</p>
<p>
The motions of the large intestines have nearly the same characters
as those of the small intestines, like these last, they are not always in
the same direction, but push the substances which are contained in
their cavity, sometimes towards the ileum and sometimes towards the
anus. But by means of this motion, these substances which have
already the character of <em>feces</em>, can never re-enter the small intestines.
The cause that prevents their return is different from that which prevents
the return into the stomach of the substances contained in the
duodenum. The obstacle in this case, we have said, is produced by
the contraction of the contractile rings, which are found at the
extremity of the two cavities; in the other, it is produced by a cause
purely mechanical, by the arrangement of the ileo-cecal valve. Hence
it follows, that if the mode of contraction of the different parts of the
intestinal canal be perverted by any cause, it might happen that their
contraction towards the pylorus would not take place when the duodenum
was affected with its anti-peristaltic motion, and then the substances
contained in it, pushed by the contraction of the annular fibres,
would re-enter the stomach. At the coecum, on the contrary, as the
obstacle is purely mechanical, so long as the ileo-cecal valve is not
broken, it will present an insurmountable obstacle to the return of the
<em>feces</em> into the small intestines.
</p>
<p>
The motions of the large intestines, sufficient to carry the feces into
the rectum, would not, in a state of health, be powerful enough to
expel them entirely, by overcoming the resistance which the sphincter
constantly presents; in expelling the feces, the contraction of the intestine
is assisted by the pressure which arises from the lowering of the
diaphragm, and by the contraction of the abdominal muscles.
</p>
<p>
We have just pointed out the motions which carry the alimentary
mass along the intestines. We may see that they have but little
resemblance among them. The only character that is common to
them is that of not being under the influence of the will. Yet there
is an exception to this in some individuals who possess the faculty of
ruminating. (The will is seen exerting itself on the production of other
<em>sensible organic motions</em>. Bayle could stop at will the pulsation of his
heart.) If we examine the motions of the digestive tube when it is
free of aliments, we see their difference in a manner not less striking.
The œsophagus exhibits those alternate motions that we have described;
a very powerful contraction of its inferior third, and then suddenly the
most complete relaxation. In the stomach we see only some undulations,
that go irregularly from one orifice to another. In the intestines,
these motions exhibit nearly the same regularity, but the groove formed
by the contraction of the annular fibres is deeper, and the undulatory
motion is not so slow. If a stimulating medicine is introduced into the
stomach, these contractions become more evident, and the motions
more rapid; but they always preserve the same character. The contraction
takes place progressively, and never in the sudden manner of
a muscle of locomotion. Of all the substances which can be used to
ascertain these motions, there is no one whose action is more efficacious
than veratrine, a new vegetable alkali extracted from the <em>veratrum
sabadilla</em>. If the external parietes of the digestive tube be excited by
any stimulus, by touching it with the finger, by a puncture, or by the
galvanic fluid, there is in the œsophagus a sudden contraction of the
longitudinal and circular fibres, which narrows the organ and shortens
it at the same time; the relaxation takes place instantaneously and in
as striking a manner. In the stomach, no motion is perceived in the
direction of its length; we see only an annular contraction, which is
developed slowly at the excited point, and which is usually not transmitted
to the neighbouring parts. In the intestines, the excitement
produces a very decided contraction, and very often in the neighbouring
parts a kind of peristaltic motion; but this motion is always slow and
does not at all resemble the sudden contraction of the œsophagus.
</p>
<p>
The difference between the motions of the œsophagus and those of
the other parts of the intestinal canal is very remarkable in birds. In
them the œsophagus appears to be entirely membranous; and yet it contracts
like a muscle of locomotion; whilst the stomach, which has red
muscles very similar to the locomotive muscles, has slow, gradual vermicular
motions, like all the canal which is below it.
</p>
<p>
There exists finally between the motions of the intestinal canal a
difference relative to the manner in which they terminate. Those of
the intestines, but little sensible during life, acquire at the moment of
death a very great intensity; whilst those of the œsophagus, before so
distinct, cease immediately, and in the most complete manner.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_32_32" id="Footnote_32_32"></a><a href="#FNanchor_32_32"><span class="label">[32]</span></a> It is not the dartos that contracts in the motions of the scrotum, it
is the skin itself that produces that vermicular motion that is observed
in this part. This motion can be produced by stimuli of very different
kinds; by the impression of cold, by pinching the skin or by fear. I
have seen these motions so great in a man on whom I was about to
operate for hydrocele, that I was obliged to wait for a long time for
fear of wounding the testicle, which, by those motions, ascended and

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_33_33" id="Footnote_33_33"></a><a href="#FNanchor_33_33"><span class="label">[33]</span></a> It might be thought from this expression, that Bichat supposed that
the great arteries influenced the course of the blood by an active contraction
analogous to the muscular contraction; but this was not his
opinion. He only wished to say, that the blood continued to move in
the great arteries solely by the influence of the heart. This contraction
of the great arterial trunks has been heretofore maintained by many
anatomists, and is even at present by some. There are at the present
day three principal theories relative to the circulation.
</p>
<p>
In the first, it is contended that all the parts of the arterial system
are irritable, and that they contract like the muscular texture; many
even add that they can dilate spontaneously, as takes place every
instant in the heart. According to this supposition, the arteries alone
would be able to continue the course of the blood.
</p>
<p>
In the second opinion, which is that of Harvey, and which is still
adopted, more particularly by the English physiologists, it is affirmed
on the contrary, that the arteries are not contractile in any point; that
if they do contract in certain cases, it is in virtue of that property
common to all the solids, by which they return upon themselves, when
the cause that has distended them ceases to act. The partisans of this
opinion conclude that the arteries have not and cannot have any influence
upon the motion of the blood which runs through them, and that
the heart is the principal, and as it were, the sole agent of the circulation.
</p>
<p>
Finally the third opinion, that which now prevails most generally in
France, consists in a union of the two preceding ones; the trunks and
principal arterial branches are considered as incapable of acting upon
the blood; but this property is attributed to the small arteries, and it is
thought to be very great in the last divisions of these vessels. Thus,
in this mixed opinion, the blood is carried by the sole influence of the
heart in all the arteries of a considerable size; it is moved in part by
the influence of the heart and in part by that of the parietes in the
smaller arteries, and finally it is moved by the sole action of the parietes
in the last arterial divisions. This action of the small vessels is also
described as the principal cause of the course of the blood in the veins.
</p>
<p>
In a question of this nature our opinion should be determined by
experiments alone. This presents many points for elucidation.
</p>
<p>
The first and the easiest to be decided is to ascertain if the arteries
are or are not irritable. The problem was in some measure resolved in
relation to the great arteries by the experiments of Haller and his disciples,
by Bichat himself, and by those which M. Nysten has made
upon man. For the purpose of being more perfectly convinced, I have
sought, by all the known means, to develop the irritability of the
arterial parietes; I have successively subjected them to the action of
pricking instruments, of caustics and of galvanism, and I have never
perceived any thing which resembled a phenomenon of irritability; and
as those who maintain the irritability of the arteries pretend that if we
do not perceive the contractions, it is because the experiments are made
on too small animals, in whom the effects are but slightly apparent in
consequence of the small diameter of these canals, I have repeated the
experiment on large animals, on horses and asses, and I have never
observed any other motions than the communicated motions.
</p>
<p>
As the great arteries show no contraction, we ought to believe that
the small ones would not; but as among the physiologists who reject
the irritability of the arterial trunks, some like Haller, do not speak of
the branches, others accord to them contractility, it becomes necessary
to test this question by experiment; now these small vessels, like the
larger ones, remain perfectly immoveable under the action of the scalpel,
caustics and a stream of galvanic fluid.
</p>
<p>
Irritability does not exist then in the large or the small arteries.
Respecting the last arterial divisions, as the vessels which form them
are so small that they cannot come under the cognizance of the senses,
at least in a state of health, no one can affirm or deny that they are
irritable. Yet from analogy we ought to conclude, that they have no
sensible motion. In cold-blooded animals, in fact, it is easy to see the
blood circulating in these vessels, and even passing into the veins; now
the vessels themselves appear to be completely immoveable.
</p>
<p>
As the arteries cannot act upon the blood by contracting in the
manner of muscles, must we conclude that they have no action upon
this fluid, and that they are in relation to it nearly like inflexible canals?
I am very far from thinking so. If in fact the arteries had no influence
upon the blood, this fluid, moved by the sole impulse of the heart,
would, from its incompressibility, be alternately in motion and at rest.
This is indeed what Bichat thought, and what he has advanced in his
other works; it is what has been since maintained in a more formal
manner by Dr. Johnson of London. It is however very easy to prove
that it is not in this way that the blood is moved in these vessels.
Open a large artery in a living animal, and the blood will escape in a
continuous jet, but by jerks; open a small artery, and the blood will
flow out in a continuous and uniform jet. The same phenomena take
place in man if the arteries are opened, either by accident or in surgical
operations. The heart being unable to produce a continuous flow,
since its action is intermittent, it must be then that the arteries act upon
the blood; this action can only be the disposition which they have to
contract, and even to obliterate their cavity entirely. Bichat thought
that his tendency to narrowing was not sufficient in the arteries to expel
the blood contained in their cavity. He maintains that the vessel does
not contract upon itself only when the blood has ceased to distend it.
If it were so, the arteries would be equivalent to inflexible canals, and
the course of the arterial blood would not be continuous; but we can
easily demonstrate that the force with which the arteries contract is
more than sufficient to drive out the blood that they contain.
</p>
<p>
When two ligatures are applied at the same time and at some
centimetres distant upon two points of an artery which furnishes no
branches, we have a portion of artery in which the blood is subjected
only to the influence of the parietes. If we make in this portion of the
vessel a small opening, almost all the blood that it contains is immediately
thrown out, and the artery is much contracted. This experiment
has been known for a long time, and uniformly succeeds. The following
is one of my own, and places, it seems to me, the phenomenon in a very
clear light. I laid bare the crural artery and vein of a dog to a certain
extent; I passed under these vessels, near the trunk, a string, which I
afterwards drew tightly at the posterior part of the thigh, so that all the
arterial blood should come to the limb by the crural artery, and all the
venous blood return to the trunk by the crural vein; I then applied a
ligature upon the artery, and this vessel was very soon completely empty
in the part below the ligature.
</p>
<p>
It is then satisfactorily proved that the force with which the arteries
contract upon themselves is sufficient to expel the blood they contain.
But what is the nature of this contraction? We have proved that it
cannot be attributed to irritability. Every thing leads to the belief
that it should be referred to the very great elasticity which the arterial
parietes enjoy, an elasticity that is brought into action, when the heart
forces a certain quantity of blood into the cavity of these vessels. This
property of the arteries being known, it is easy to conceive how the
principal agent of the arterial motion, being alternate, the course of
fluid is yet continuous. The elasticity of the arterial parietes is similar
to that of the reservoir of air in certain pumps with an alternate
action, and which notwithstanding throw out the fluid in a continuous
manner.
</p>
<p>
It is not enough to know the kind of influence which the contraction
of the arteries has on the motion of the arterial blood; it is necessary
to know if this contraction does not influence in a sensible manner the
course of the blood in the veins. This is elucidated by the following
experiment. Lay bare, as in the preceding experiment, the crural
artery and vein of a dog; tie the limb strongly, taking care not to
include these vessels; afterwards tie the crural vein, and make a small
opening in it below the ligature, of one or two lines in length; the
blood flows out in a continuous jet. If the artery be compressed, so as
to intercept the course of blood in it, the jet still continues a short
time; but it is seen sensibly to diminish, as the artery is becoming
empty. It at length ceases entirely when the artery is completely
emptied; and though the vein remains distended with blood along its
whole extent, it does not flow out at the small wound. If the compression
be taken off of the artery, the blood enters it with force, and
almost at the same instant it begins again to flow from the opening in
the vein, and the jet is reestablished as before. If we check the course
of the blood in the artery, there is but a feeble jet from the vein; it is
the same if the passage of this fluid is alternately intercepted and permitted.
</p>
<p>
I make the same phenomenon evident in another way; I introduce
into the crural artery the extremity of a syringe filled with water at
the temperature of 30 degrees of the centigrade thermometer; I push
the piston slowly, and soon the blood goes out by the opening in the
vein, at first alone and afterwards mixed with water, and it forms a jet
the more considerable in proportion to the force with which the piston
is pushed.
</p>
<p>
To prove, as we have done, that the heart maintains an evident influence
on the course of the blood in the capillary vessels, is not to
advance that these vessels have no action on the motion of this fluid.
Many physiological phenomena, on the contrary, prove that the capillaries
can aid with more or less facility the passage of the blood, and
consequently sensibly influence its course.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_34_34" id="Footnote_34_34"></a><a href="#FNanchor_34_34"><span class="label">[34]</span></a> Under no circumstance does the stomach rise up, as Bichat calls it.
We have, in a preceding note, explained the ordinary motions of this
viscus, in a state of vacuity, during digestion and under the influence
of an internal or external stimulus. None of these motions are sufficient
to produce that sudden and energetic expulsion which characterizes
vomiting. The opinion that the stomach rises up in vomiting
originated in a time of ignorance, and we ought not to be astonished
that it should find advocates even in our day. This has not however
been uniformly adopted; Bayle and P. Chirac opposed it by experiments;
Senac, Van Swieten and Duverney declared themselves against
it; but Haller, by adopting it, suddenly changed the views and removed
the uncertainty of a great number of physiologists, who, not taking the
labour of making experiments for themselves, loved to repose on the
faith of a celebrated name. In physiology the opinions of Haller are
certainly entitled to very great weight; this is because this wise observer,
before announcing them as a general proposition, was accustomed to
repeat many times the experiments on which he founded them; but in
this case he did not sufficiently question the use of the stomach in
vomiting.
</p>
<p>
He has made four experiments only, less for the purpose of satisfying
himself that the phenomenon existed, than to see it such as he supposed
it. It is very difficult, even for the best mind, to divest itself in
observing, of the ideas previously received without examination. It
may then be believed, that Haller in this way saw but superficially.
These considerations determined me some years since, to satisfy myself
of what takes place in vomiting, and of the part which the stomach
performs in it. I shall relate briefly the experiments which I tried on
the subject. The first was made on a dog of middling size, whom I had
made to swallow six grains of emetic. When this medicine had excited
nausea, I cut through the linea alba opposite the stomach, and introduced
my finger into the abdomen. At each nausea, I felt it very
powerfully compressed above by the liver, which the diaphragm pushed
down, and below by the intestines, which were compressed by the
abdominal muscles. The stomach also appeared to me to be compressed;
but instead of feeling it contract, it appeared to me, on the
contrary, to increase in size. The nauseas became more frequent, and
the more marked efforts, which precede vomiting, appeared. Vomiting
finally took place, and then I felt my finger pressed with a force truly
extraordinary. The stomach rid itself of a part of the aliments it
contained; but I distinguished no sensible contraction in it. The
nausea having ceased for a short time, I enlarged the opening in the
linea alba, for the purpose of observing the stomach. As soon as the
incision was enlarged, the stomach presented itself at it, and made an
effort to come out of the abdomen; but I prevented it with my hand.
The nauseas returned in a few minutes, and I was not a little surprized
to see the stomach filled with air, as they came on. In a very little
time the organ had become three times its former size; vomiting soon
followed this dilatation, and it was evident to all who were present, that
the stomach had been compressed without having experienced the
least contraction in its fibres. This organ rid itself of air and of a
portion of aliments; but, immediately after the exit of these substances,
it was flaccid, and it was not till after some minutes, that gradually
contracting, it became nearly of the same dimensions as it was before
the vomiting. A third vomiting took place, and we saw again the same
series of phenomena.
</p>
<p>
For the purpose of ascertaining whence the air came, which, during
the nauseas, distended the stomach, I applied a ligature on the stomach
near the pylorus, so as to close the communication which exists between
this organ and the small intestines, and I made the dog swallow six
grains more of emetic in powder. At the end of half an hour the
vomiting returned, accompanied by the same phenomena. The distension
of the stomach by air was at least as marked as in the preceding
experiment; besides there was no appearance of contraction of the
stomach, and we could not even clearly distinguish its peristaltic
motion. The animal having been killed some moments after, in an
experiment which had no relation to vomiting, we examined the abdomen.
We saw that the stomach was of considerable size; its texture
was flaccid and not all contracted; the ligature, at the pylorus, was
not displaced, and the air had not been able to pass this way.
</p>
<p>
Having repeated this experiment and uniformly obtained the same
results, I thought it right to conclude with Chirac and Duverney, that
the mechanical pressure, exerted on the stomach by the diaphragm and
the abdominal muscles, is much concerned in the production of vomiting;
now, if it were so, by removing this pressure from the stomach,
vomiting would be prevented; experiment confirmed this conjecture.
</p>
<p>
I injected into the vein of a dog four grains of an emetic dissolved
in two ounces of common water, (in this way vomiting is produced
quicker and more certainly;) I afterwards made an opening in the
abdomen, and when the first efforts of vomiting began, I quickly drew
out the whole of the stomach, which did not prevent the efforts of
vomiting from continuing. The animal made precisely the same efforts
as if he had vomited; but nothing came from the stomach; this organ
remained completely immoveable. I wished then to see what would
be the effect of pressure made on the stomach; for this purpose, I
placed my right hand on the anterior face of this organ, and my left hand
on the posterior face. The pressure was hardly commenced when the
efforts of vomiting, that is to say, the contraction of the diaphragm and
the abdominal muscles powerfully recommenced. I suspended the
pressure; the abdominal muscles and diaphragm soon suspended their
contractions. I renewed the pressure; the contractions of the muscles
began again; then I suspended it; they ceased; and seven or eight
times in succession. The last time, I made a strong and continued
pressure; this produced a real vomiting. A part of the substances
contained in the stomach was thrown off. I repeated this experiment
on another dog; I observed the same facts; only I remarked moreover
that the contractions of the diaphragm and the abdominal muscles can
be produced by merely drawing by the œsophagus.
</p>
<p>
In the experiment just related, the emetic substance was introduced
into the veins, and we have already remarked, that the effects were
quicker and more certain than if the same substance had been introduced
into the stomach. This alone should make us suspect that
vomiting is not owing, as is generally believed, to the impression of the
emetic on the mucous membrane of the stomach; for, in this case, its
action ought to have been more prompt when it was placed directly in
contact with this membrane, than when it arrived at it with the blood
after having passed through the lungs and the four cavities of the heart.
For the purpose of elucidating this question and of seeing if the contractions
of the muscles were the result of the impression produced on
the stomach, or if they were excited more directly by the emetic substance
mixed with the blood, I made the following experiment:
</p>
<p>
I opened the abdomen of a dog, and having brought the stomach out
at the opening, I tied with care the vessels that went to this viscus, and
I removed the whole of it (I ascertained in some of the preceding
experiments that a dog can live eight and forty hours after his stomach
has been removed.) I made a suture in the abdominal parietes; then,
having laid bare the crural vein, I injected into its cavity a solution of
two grains of emetic in an ounce and a half of water. I had hardly
finished the injection when the dog began to have nausea, and he soon
made all the efforts that an animal does when he vomits. These efforts
appeared to me to be even more violent and longer continued than in
ordinary vomiting. The dog remained quiet about a quarter of an
hour; I then renewed the injection, and I forced two grains more of
emetic into the crural vein; this was followed with the same efforts of
vomiting. I repeated the experiment many times and always with the
same success; but this experiment suggested to me another, which I
performed in the following way: I took a dog of good size, from whom
I removed the stomach, as I had done in the preceding experiment; I
introduced into the abdomen a hog’s bladder, to the neck of which I
had fixed, by threads, a canula of gum elastic; I put the end of this
canula into the extremity of the œsophagus, and I fixed it there also by
threads, so that the bladder resembled somewhat the stomach, and was,
like it, in communication with the œsophagus. I introduced into the
bladder about a pint of common water; this distended it, but did not
fill it completely. A suture was made in the wound of the abdomen,
and four grains of emetic were injected into the jugular vein. Nausea
soon appeared, and was followed with real efforts of vomiting; finally,
after some minutes, the animal vomited up abundantly the water from
the bladder.
</p>
<p>
It followed evidently from the preceding experiments, that the
abdominal muscles and the diaphragm concurred to produce vomiting;
but it remained to be ascertained, what was the part of the diaphragm
in the production of this phenomenon, and what was that of the
abdominal muscles.
</p>
<p>
If the diaphragm received only diaphragmatic nerves, it would be
easy to resist the contraction of this muscle by dividing these nerves;
but it also receives filaments from dorsal pairs, and these filaments are
sufficient to support its contractions. Yet experiment shows us, that
the diaphragmatic nerves being cut, the contraction of the diaphragm
is very evidently diminished in power, and it may be said, without much
hazard of mistake, that this muscle loses, by this division, three quarters
of its contractile force. It was then useful to see what influence the
division of these nerves would have on the production of this phenomenon.
I made this division in the neck of a dog of three years old, and
I afterwards injected into the jugular vein three grains of emetic; there
was only a very feeble vomiting; another injection of emetic, a quarter
of an hour after, excited no vomiting. I opened the abdomen and
endeavoured to produce vomiting by compressing the stomach. The
compression, though very powerful and long continued, excited no
effort of vomiting; it did not even appear to produce nausea. I thought
that this circumstance might be owing to the idiosyncrasy of the animal;
but having many times since repeated this experiment, I have never
obtained any other result.
</p>
<p>
In order to understand what part the abdominal muscles by their
contractions take in vomiting, we ought to observe what takes place
when these muscles are unable to act. There is but one way of coming
at this, which is, to separate these muscles from their attachments
at the sides of the linea alba; this we have done on many animals;
we have detached successively the external oblique, the internal
oblique and the transversalis, leaving on the anterior face of the abdomen
only the peritoneum. When these muscles are thus removed, we
can see very distinctly through the peritoneum, all that takes place in
this cavity; we distinguish, for example, perfectly the peristaltic
motion of the stomach and the intestines; and if the stomach contracts
it will be easy to see it. The abdominal muscles being thus detached, I
injected three grains of emetic into the jugular vein, and also immediately
nausea and vomiting took place by the contraction of the diaphragm
alone. It was curious to see, in the convulsive contraction of
this muscle, the whole intestinal mass pushed downwards, and pressing
strongly against the peritoneum, which was ruptured in some places.
In this case, the linea alba, formed by a very strong fibrous texture, is
the only part which resists the pressure of the viscera; its existence
then is indispensable to the action of vomiting; perhaps it performs an
analogous office in the ordinary state. This experiment proves that
vomiting can be produced by the efforts of the diaphragm alone; this
is also confirmed by the following experiment:
</p>
<p>
I detached, as above, the abdominal muscles and laid bare the peritoneum;
I afterwards divided the diaphragmatic nerves, and injected an
emetic into the veins. The animal had some nausea, but nothing more.
Though I repeated many times the injection of the emetic, I never was
able to produce any sensible effort of vomiting.
</p>
<p>
From the different experiments that we have just related, and from
the facts that we made known in a preceding note relative to the
motions of the œsophagus, we may conclude, without any hazard,
</p>
<p>
1st. That vomiting can take place without any contraction of the
stomach.
</p>
<p>
2d. That the pressure exerted immediately on the stomach by the
diaphragm and abdominal muscles, appears to be sufficient to produce
vomiting, when the occlusion of the inferior part of the œsophagus offers
no obstacle to it.
</p>
<p>
3d. That the convulsive contraction of the diaphragm and abdominal
muscles, in vomiting from tartarized antimony and emetic substances
properly so called, is the result of a direct action of these substances
on the nervous system and independent of the impression felt by the
stomach.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_35_35" id="Footnote_35_35"></a><a href="#FNanchor_35_35"><span class="label">[35]</span></a> The motions of the iris cannot be attributed to an active expansion
of an erectile texture; they are owing to the contractions of two
muscular layers, one of which is radiated and enlarges the opening of
the pupil, the other is orbicular and contracts it.
</p>
<p>
The motions of the iris, like all those which have muscular contraction
for their cause, can be excited for a considerable time after death
by the galvanic fluid. During life, the motions of the pupil are produced
in man, by the more or less vivid impression of light on the retina. But
they are beyond the influence of the will; in birds on the contrary, they
appear to be entirely subjected to it. In these animals, we can even
after death, and on an eye entirely detached from the body, produce
the motions of the iris by pricking the optic nerve.</p></div>

solid and liquid nourishment, it is not rare to find in him the stomach
and intestines considerably lessened in their two dimensions, the internal
cavity almost entirely effaced, the length being hardly a third of what
it was before the disease. We truly say then with Bichat that is a
contraction from a want of extension. But that this mode of contractility
is as he says perfectly independent of life and owing only to
the arrangement of parts, is what cannot be admitted. If it were so
in fact, by emptying the stomach after death, we might produce a contraction
similar to that which is produced during life. Now experiment
shows us, that this does not take place. The stomach when emptied
remains flaccid, and does not contract in any perceptible degree.</p></div>

certain that this movement takes place, because no one has seen it.</p></div>

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_VIII" id="CHAPTER_VIII"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER VIII.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="fs50">OF THE ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ANIMAL LIFE.</span></h3>


<p>If there be any circumstance, which establishes a real
line of demarcation between the two lives, this circumstance
undoubtedly is the mode and epoch of their origin.
The organic life is active from the very first moment of
our existence; the animal life begins after birth only;
for without external excitants the latter is as necessarily
condemned to inaction, as without the fluids of the œconomy,
which are its internal excitants, the former would
become extinct. But the subject, on which we are now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
engaged deserves a more particular discussion, and in the
first place let us examine, in what manner the animal life,
which for some time is absolutely null, is born as it were
and developed.</p>


<h4>I. <em>In the fœtus the first order of the functions of the
animal life is not as yet in action.</em></h4>

<p>The instant, at which the fœtus begins to exist, is nearly
that of its conception; but this existence, the sphere of
which is every day enlarged, is not the same as that,
which the child is destined to enjoy after birth.</p>

<p>The state, in which the fœtus exists while in the womb,
has been compared to that of a profound sleep. Such
comparison is inexact. In a state of sleep the animal
life is only in part suspended. In the fœtus it has not
commenced. We have seen in fact, that this life is made
up of the simultaneous or distinct exercise of the senses,
of the nerves, of the brain, of the organs of locomotion,
and the voice. Now in these different functions every
thing in such state is inactive.</p>

<p>Every sensation supposes the action of external bodies
upon our own, together with the perception of such
action; a perception which takes place by virtue of the
sensibility of the system, which is either general or particular,
for the tact is the faculty of perceiving general
impressions, and has for its object to warn us of the
presence of bodies, together with their common attributes,
such as heat, cold, dryness, or humidity, hardness
or softness. To perceive the particular modifications of
bodies is the business of the senses.</p>

<p>Has the fœtus in utero any general sensations? To
decide this question, let us enquire whether any impressions
are capable there of exercising its tact. The fœtus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span>
lives in a temperature at all times the same, swims in a
fluid, and is thrown from time to time against the parietes
of the womb: such are the three sources of its general
sensations.</p>

<p>We shall now remark, that the two former are next to
nothing, and that the fœtus cannot have a consciousness
of the medium, in which it is nourished, nor of the heat,
by which it is penetrated, for every sensation supposes a
comparison between an actual and a past state of being.
We are sensible of cold, only because we have experienced
an antecedent heat; were the temperature of the
atmosphere invariable, we should have no idea whatever
of temperature. The Laplander enjoys himself in a
climate, which would be pain, and death to the Negro, if
suddenly transported thither. It is not at the time of the
solstices, but at that of the equinoxes, that our sensations
of heat, and cold are the most lively. The reason of
which must be, that at the latter seasons, their varieties
are more numerous, and occasion more frequent comparisons
between that, which we feel and that which we have
felt.</p>

<p>What we have now said of temperature, we may repeat
with respect to the waters of the amnios: the fœtus cannot
be sensible of their influence, because the contact of
any other medium is unknown to it. Before bathing,
we are not sensible of the air, after bathing, the impression
made by it upon us is unpleasant. It then affects us
because there has been an interruption of its action upon
the cutaneous organ.</p>

<p>Is the shock of the parietes of the matrix a more real
cause of excitement, than the waters of the amnios, or
temperature? At first we might be inclined to answer
this question in the affirmative, because the fœtus being
only at intervals subject to such stimulus, there should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
appear to result from thence a sensation. But let us
remark that the density<a name="FNanchor_41_41" id="FNanchor_41_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> of the uterus in a state of pregnancy
being little greater than that of its waters, the
impression must be trifling. In fact the more the consistence
of bodies resembles that of the medium in which
we live, the less powerful will be their action upon us.
Water for instance, when reduced into vapour in our
common fogs, and mists, affects the tact but slightly; in
proportion as it is condensed it is the cause of a livelier
affection.</p>

<p>The air then, to the animal which breathes, is truly the
general comparative term, to which he refers all the sensations
of tact. If the hand be plunged into carbonic
acid gas, such substance will not affect the tact because its
density is little different from that of the air.</p>

<p>The variety then of these sensations is in proportion to
the difference existing between the density of the air, and
that of the bodies, which are the occasion of such sensations.
In the same way, the measure of the sensation
of the fœtus must be the excess of density in the matrix
above that of its waters. Now such excess being very
inconsiderable, the sensation of it must be very obtuse.</p>

<p>This assertion with respect to the fœtus will become
more general if we add to it the following: namely, that
the mucous membranes, which are the seat of an inward
tact have not as yet begun to exercise their functions.
These membranes, after birth, being continually in contact
with extraneous substances, possess in these bodies<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
so many causes of irritation, which being continually
repeated, become excitants to the organs: but in the
fœtus there is no succession in these causes. The same
urine, the same meconium, the same mucus at all times
exercise their action upon the bladder, the intestines, and
pituitary membrane.</p>

<p>From all this we may conclude, that the general sensations
of the fœtus are very inconsiderable, though it
should appear that the child in this state is surrounded by
many of the causes, which are hereafter to beget sensations.
Neither are the particular sensations of the fœtus more active;
indeed they cannot be so for their causes are absent.</p>

<p>The eye which is closed by the pupillary membrane,
and the nostrils, which are scarcely indicated, would not
be capable of receiving impressions, even in the supposition
that light and odour could act upon them. Applied
against the palate, the tongue is in contact with nothing
capable of producing savour. Were it in contact with
the waters of the amnios, the effect would be the same,
because as we have said, there is no sensation, where
there is no variety of impression. The saliva of one
person to another person possesses savour, to the individual
himself it is insipid.</p>

<p>The ear in like manner is awakened by no sound. All
is calm, every thing reposes with the little individual.</p>

<p>Here then we have proved, that four of the gates of
sensation are shut in the fœtus; and let us now observe
that the nullity of action in the senses which we have
mentioned, must occasion very nearly the same nullity
with respect to that of the touch.<a name="FNanchor_42_42" id="FNanchor_42_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>
<p>In fact, this sense is especially destined to confirm the
notions which are acquired by the others, and to rectify
them, for the latter are frequently illusory&mdash;the touch is
always the agent of truth.<a name="FNanchor_43_43" id="FNanchor_43_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> In attributing to the touch
such use, nature has submitted it directly to the will;
light, odours, and sounds affect their respective organs
independently of the will.</p>

<p>The exercise of the other senses precedes that of the
touch, they are the occasion of it. If a man were born
without sight, hearing, smell, or taste, can we conceive
in what way, he would be possessed of the sense of touch?</p>

<p>The fœtus resembles such a man; it possesses wherewithal
to exercise the touch in its hands, which are
already developed, and in the parietes of the matrix.
Nevertheless the fœtus is never in action, because in
seeing, in hearing, in smelling, and in tasting nothing,
it is not disposed to exercise the touch in any way. Its
members are little better than what to the tree are its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
branches, which do not transmit the impression of the
bodies, with which they are entangled.</p>

<p>I shall here notice a great difference between the tact
and the touch; they were formerly confounded by physiologists;
the impressions of the latter are always directed
by the will, those of the former do not depend on it. We
shall conclude that the portion of the animal life which
constitutes sensation, does not exist in the fœtus.</p>

<p>This nullity of action in the senses supposes the same
deficiency of action in the nerves, which belong to them,
and in that of the brain from whence they issue; for
the business of the former is to transmit, of the latter
to receive. Now without objects for transmission and
reception, the two functions cannot have place.</p>

<p>From perception are immediately derived the memory
and imagination; from these the powers of the judgment
and the will. All this series of faculties then has not had
a beginning in the fœtus, because the fœtus has not perceived,
or had sensation. The brain exists in a state of
expectation, it possesses all that is requisite for action.
It does not want excitability, but stimulus. The first
division of the animal life in consequence, or that, which
relates to the action of exterior bodies, on the animal,
has scarcely an outline in the fœtus. Let us examine
whether the same be true of the second division of the
animal life, or that which relates to the reaction of the living
body.</p>


<h4>II. <em>Locomotion exists, but belongs in the fœtus to the
organic life.</em></h4>

<p>When we see the strict connexion which exists in
animals, between sensation and their voluntary efforts,
we might be induced to believe, that voluntary motion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span>
increases or diminishes with the increase or diminution
of sentiment; for as sentiment furnishes out the materials
of the will, when it does not exist, volition cannot exist:
from induction to induction, it might thus be proved that
in the fœtus the muscles must be totally inactive.</p>

<p>Nevertheless the fœtus moves, and sometimes even
very strong shocks are the result of its motions. The
reason why it does not produce sound, is because the
medium for the production of sound is wanting. But
how can we ally the inertia of the first part of the animal
life with the activity of the second. It is thus.</p>

<p>We have seen in speaking of the passions, that the
muscles of locomotion are brought into action in two
manners. 1st, by the will; 2dly, by sympathy. This
last mode of action occurs, when from the affection of an
inward organ the brain is affected also, and occasions a
motion which, in such case, is involuntary. A passion, for
instance, affects the liver, the liver the brain, the brain
the voluntary muscles. Here it is the liver, not the
brain, which is the principle of motion: so that the
muscles, though always thrown into action, immediately
from the irradiations of the brain, belong nevertheless, as
to their functions, sometimes to the one life, sometimes
to the other.</p>

<p>Hence it is easy to conceive in what way the fœtus
moves: with the fœtus, locomotion is not a portion of
the animal life; its exercise does not suppose a pre-existent
will; it is purely a sympathetic effect.</p>

<p>In utero the phenomena of the organic life succeed
each other with an extreme rapidity; a thousand different
motions are incessantly connected in the organs of
circulation and nutrition. In these, every thing is energetically
in action. But this activity of the organic life
supposes a frequent influence exerted upon the brain by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
the inward organs, and consequently as many reactions
on the part of the brain by sympathy upon the muscles.
Besides, the brain is at such time more susceptible of
such sort of influence, being much more developed than
the other organs, and entirely passive on the side of the
sensations.</p>

<p>We may now conceive what the motions or the fœtus
are. They belong to the same class as many of those
of the adult, which have not been as yet sufficiently
distinguished. They are the same as those which are
produced in the voluntary muscles by the passions; they
resemble those of the man who sleeps, and who moves
without dreaming, for nothing is more common than
violent agitation in sleep succeeding difficult digestion.
The stomach is in strong action; it acts upon the brain;
the brain upon the muscles.</p>

<p>I might find a number of other involuntary organic
motions taking place in the voluntary muscles of the
adult, and consequently adducible to my present purpose;
but what I have said on this subject will suffice. Let us
remark only, that the organic motions, as well as the
sympathetic affection of the brain, which is the seat of
them, must gradually dispose this organ, and the muscles
of the fœtus, the one to the perception of sensations, and
the other to the motions of the animal life, which are to
commence after birth. But on this head I shall refer to
the memoirs of Monsieur Cabanis.</p>

<p>From what has been said, then, I believe we may confidently
assert, that in the fœtus the animal life does not
exist, and that all the actions which take place at this
age, depend upon the organic life. The fœtus, indeed,
has nothing of the especial character of the animal. Its
very existence is that of the vegetable; and its destruction
can only be said to be that of a living body, not of an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
animated being. Thus, in the cruel alternative of sacrificing
the life of the mother, or that of the child, the
choice cannot be doubtful.</p>

<p>The crime of destroying a fellow-creature is much
more relative to his animal, than to his organic life.&mdash;We
regret the being who feels, who reflects, who wills,
who acts accordingly, and not the being which breathes,
which is nourished, which is the seat of the circulation
and the secretions. It is the former, whose violent death
is accompanied with those images of horror, under which
we look on homicide. In proportion then as in the series
of animals, their intellectual functions diminish, is diminished
also the painful sentiment which we feel at sight of
their destruction.</p>

<p>If the blow, which terminates by an assassination the
life of a man, were to destroy his organic life only, and
suffer the other to subsist without alteration, such blow
would be regarded with indifference, would excite neither
pity for the victim, nor horror against the aggressor.</p>


<h4>III. <em>Development of the animal life, education of its
organs.</em></h4>

<p>A new mode of existence commences for the infant
after birth; a variety of functions are added to its organic
life; their aggregate become more complicated; their
results are multiplied. As for the animal life, it only
begins; and at this period a number of relations are
established between the little individual and what surrounds
him. It is then that every thing assumes with
him a different mode of being, but at this remarkable
epoch of the two lives, where the one is augmented by
almost the half, and where the other commences only,
they take upon them both a distinct character, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span>
aggrandisement of the first by no means follows the same
laws as the development of the second.</p>

<p>We shall soon remark, that the organs of the internal
life attain at once their perfection, and that from the
instant at which they begin to act, they act with as much
precision as they ever will do. On the contrary, the
organs of the external life require a species of education;
they arrive only by degrees at the perfection which we
afterwards see in them. This important difference should
be thoroughly examined. Let us begin by appreciating
of what the animal life at first consists.</p>

<p>In examining the different functions of this life, which
start at once into existence, we shall observe in their
development a slow and graduated progress.&mdash;We shall
see, that it is insensibly and by means of a real education
that the organs attain a precision of action.</p>

<p>The sensations are at first confused; they transmit only
general images; the eye has only the sensation of light;
the ear that of sound only; the nose only that of smell.
As yet there is nothing distinct in these general affections
of the senses; but from habit the strength of the
first impression is lessened and the particular sensations
take place. The great differences of colours, sounds,
smells, and savours, become perceptible; by little and
little their secondary differences also are perceived, and
after a certain lapse of time the child has learnt to see, to
hear, to smell, to taste, and to touch.</p>

<p>After successfully undergoing the operation for the
cataract, the patient, who has previously been totally
blind, is sensible of light only, and learns by gradation
to distinguish the objects which reflect it. Another person,
before whom, as I have said, for the first time is
exhibited the magnificent spectacle of an opera, at the
first glance, perceives only a whole, which delights him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
and only by degrees is able to isolate the enjoyments of
which the dance, the music, and the decorations are productive.</p>

<p>The education of the brain is similar to that of the
senses. Whatever depends upon its action, acquires the
perfection, to which it is destined, by degrees only. The
powers of perception, memory and imagination, which
are all of them preceded and occasioned by the sensations,
increase and extend in proportion as by repeated
excitement they are brought into exercise.&mdash;The judgment,
of which they form the triple base, associates but
irregularly at first its motions, which themselves are but
irregular. In a short time a greater degree of perspicuity
is observed in its operations, and lastly they become
precise and rigorous.</p>

<p>The voice and the agents of locomotion exemplify the
same phenomenon: the cries of young animals at first
are only an unformed sound, which possesses no sort of
character: by age they are gradually modified, and after
long repeated exercise affect the peculiar consonances of
the species, by which, and particularly during the season
of their loves, the individual of the same species is never
deceived.<a name="FNanchor_44_44" id="FNanchor_44_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a> I do not instance the speech of man, for this
is evidently the fruit of education.</p>

<p>In examining the newly born animal, its muscles will
be seen continually in action. As every thing is new to
it, every thing is an excitant to it, and makes it move; it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
endeavours to touch every thing, but neither progression,
nor the power of standing can have place when the contractions
of the voluntary muscles are so numerous. It
is necessary for such, that habit shall have taught it
to combine particular contractions with other particular
contractions; until then it stumbles and falls at every
moment.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the inclination of the pelvis in the fœtus,
the disposition of the femora, and the want of curvature
in the spine, adapt it but little for standing immediately
after birth; but with these causes is certainly also combined
the want of exercise.<a name="FNanchor_45_45" id="FNanchor_45_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> Who does not know, that
if a limb be suffered to remain immoveable for a length
of time, it loses the habit of moving, and that when
afterwards its service is required, it requires a new kind
of education before it can exercise its movements with
any regularity or precision. The man, who for a long
time should condemn himself to silence, would experience
in like manner the same embarrassment in his first
attempt at utterance.</p>

<p>From these considerations we may conclude that our
exterior life, to allow myself the expression, is learnt,
and requires before it can be perfected, a sort of apprenticeship.</p>


<h4>IV. <em>Of the influence of society over the education of
the organs of the animal life.</em></h4>

<p>Over this sort of education, which the organs of the
animal life receive, society exercises a very great influence;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
it enlarges the sphere of action of some of them,
lessens it for others, and modifies it in them all.</p>

<p>I shall first remark, that it constantly gives to some
of the organs a perfection greater than naturally should
be their portion. Such in fact is the nature of our occupations
as always to require the especial action of some
one, or other of these organs. The ear of the musician,
the palate of the cook, the brain of the philosopher, the
muscles of the dancer, and the larynx of the singer,
receive in addition to the general education of the exterior
life, a particular education.</p>

<p>Under these considerations, the occupations of mankind
might be divided into three classes. The first
would comprehend all those, which especially regard the
senses, such as painting, music, and sculpture, the acts of
the perfumer and the cook, and in a word all those the
results of which are productive of pleasure to the senses.
In the second would be ranged the occupations, wherein
the brain is chiefly called into action; such as poetry,
the sciences of nomenclature, the mathematics and metaphysics.
The occupations of dancing, equitation, and the
mechanic acts would form the third class.<a name="FNanchor_46_46" id="FNanchor_46_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a></p>

<p>Each several occupation then of the individual, brings
into permanent activity, some one organ in particular,
and gives it a peculiar perfection. The ear of the musician
in a piece of harmony, and the eye of the painter in
a picture, distinguish many things which entirely escape
the vulgar. It frequently happens that this perfection of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
action, is accompanied in the more exercised organ with
an excess of nutrition: this we may frequently observe
in the muscles of the arm of the baker, in those of the
inferior limbs of the dancer, and in those of the countenance
of the player.</p>

<p>In the second place I have asserted that society contracts
the sphere of action, which should naturally belong
to many of the external organs. Indeed, for the sole
reason that any one of them is the more occupied, the
others must be less so, and lose in aptitude what is gained
by the single organ. The most common observation will
prove this truth at every moment.</p>

<p>Examine the philosopher, who in his abstract meditations,
and in the silence of the closet condemns to inaction
his external and locomotive powers. Examine him by
chance attempting any exercise of the body, and you will
laugh at his awkwardness and air of constraint; his
sublime conceptions astonish, the heaviness of his movements
is amusing.</p>

<p>Examine on the contrary the dancer, who by the lightness
of his steps exhibits apparently to the eye whatever
the graces of fable have set before the imagination. It
might be imagined perhaps that the profoundest meditations,
have been productive of such felicity of motion;
but let him be conversed with, and nothing very surprising
will be found in the man.</p>

<p>The observing mind, which analyses the different individuals
of society at every moment, will be led to similar
remarks. Perfection of action in the locomotive organs,
concurring with a like perfection of intellect, will seldom
be found.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>


<h4>V. <em>Of the laws, which regulate the education of the
organs of the animal life.</em></h4>

<p>It is manifest then that society inverts the natural order
of education in the animal life, and that it irregularly
distributes to the different organs of this life, a perfection
which they would otherwise enjoy in a more uniform
proportion.</p>

<p>A determined sum of power, has been attributed to
every individual, which sum must always remain the
same, whether it be equally or unequally distributed,
accordingly the activity of one organ must imply more
or less inactivity in the others.</p>

<p>This truth will conduct us to the fundamental principles
of all social education whatever; namely, that no
individual at the same time, should be applied to many
studies, even if it be wished that he should succeed in
all of them. Philosophers have long insisted upon this
maxim, but I doubt whether the moral reasons on which
they have founded it, are all of them together worth this
single and beautiful physiological observation by which it
is demonstrated, that for the purpose of augmenting the
powers of one organ, there are no other means than those
of diminishing the powers of the others. On this account
I shall dwell upon this observation, and prove its truth
by a variety of facts.</p>

<p>The ear, and especially the touch, acquire in the blind
man, a perfection which would hardly be credited, were
not its reality proved by daily observation. The deaf
and dumb possess in the eye an accuracy of sight, which
is unknown to those, with whom the powers of the ear
and utterance are unfolded. Little connexion with external
objects, enfeebles the senses of persons who are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
subject to ecstasy, but gives the brain a power of contemplation,
such as to make it appear, that every part of
the animal life, excepting that organ, during such affection
is in a state of sleep.</p>

<p>But what occasion is there for seeking in extraordinary
facts, the proof of a law which the animal in its healthy
state exemplifies at every moment. Let us consider in
the series of animals the relative perfection of each organ,
and it will be seen at once, that where any one of them
is excellent, the others are less perfect. The eagle, which
has a very piercing sight, has but a very obtuse sense of
smell; in the dog, the latter sense is extremely fine, the
former dull. The sense of hearing is particularly acute
in the hare, that of touch in the bat; the cerebral action
predominates in the monkey, and vigour of motion in
the feræ.</p>

<p>Every species then possesses some particular division
of its animal life, in a degree of excellence superior to
that of the others. Not a single instance will be found,
where the perfection of one organ does not appear to be
acquired at the expense of the others. Man in general,
abstraction being made of every other consideration, has
the ear particularly good, and in the natural order of
things, this must be so; because his speech, which exercises
the ear incessantly, is for this organ a permanent
cause of activity, and therefore of perfection. And not
only in the animal life is this law remarkable; but it
appears to have place also, in all the phenomena of the
organic life. The morbid affection of one of the kidneys,
of one of the parotid glands, will double the secretion of
the other.</p>

<p>Let us now examine what happens in the process of
digestion. Each system at such time is the seat of an
exaltation of the vital powers. Immediately after the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>
entry of the aliments into the stomach, the action of all
the gastric viscera is augmented, the powers of life are
concentrated about the epigastrium, and abandon the
organs of the external life; from thence arise, as authors
have observed, the lassitude, the inaptitude of the senses
to the reception of external impressions, the tendency of
the individual to sleep, and the cold which is so frequently
felt in the integuments.</p>

<p>The gastric digestion being completed, the vascular
succeeds, and the chyle is introduced into the circulatory
torrent, for the purpose of undergoing the influence of this
system, and that of respiration; accordingly the blood-vessels
and lungs become in their turn, the focus of an
increased action, the pulse rises, and the movements of
the thorax are precipitated.<a name="FNanchor_47_47" id="FNanchor_47_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a></p>

<p>It is then the glandular, then the nutritive system which
enjoy a marked superiority in the state of their vital
powers. Lastly, when these powers have been successively
developed, over all the system, they return to the
organs of the animal life, the senses resume their activity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
the functions of the brain their energy, the muscles their
vigour. Whoever reflects upon what he has experienced
after a somewhat copious repast, will be easily convinced
of the truth of these remarks.</p>

<p>In this way, the whole of the functions represent a
species of circle, of which the one half belongs to the
organic, the other to the animal life, the vital powers
seem successively to traverse these two halves. When
they are found in one half, the other is proportionably
deprived of them, nearly in the same manner as every
thing appears to languish and be reanimated in the two
portions of the globe, accordingly as the sun refuses, or
sheds down his beneficent influence.</p>

<p>Should any farther proof be required of this inequality
of distribution with regard to the vital powers, we may
find it in the process of nutrition. This process has
always an excess of action in some one of the organs,
which at such time may be said to live more than the
others do. In the fœtus, the brain and the nerves, the
inferior members after birth, and at the age of puberty,
the genital parts and breast appear to grow at the expense
of the others.</p>

<p>From such a variety of considerations, we may establish
the following to be a fundamental law of the distribution
of the vital powers, namely, that when they increase
in one part, they decrease in the rest of the living œconomy,
that the sum of them can never be augmented, and
that they only transfer themselves successively from one
organ to another. By the help of these general data, it
is easy to perceive why we cannot at the same time attain
to perfection in the various parts of our animal life, why
we cannot at the same time excel in all the sciences.</p>

<p>Universality of knowledge in the same individual is a
chimera; it is repugnant to the laws of our organization,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
and if history afford us some few instances of extraordinary
men, who have thrown an equal light upon many
of the sciences, such instances are but so many exceptions
to the common laws of nature; for who are we, that we
should venture on the pursuit of many things at once, and
hope to attain in all of them a perfection, which for the
most part, even when we have but a single object in view,
escapes us?</p>

<p>Were we capable of following at once a number of
occupations, such occupations would be those which have
the greatest analogy among themselves with respect to the
organs which they bring into exercise: and by restraining
ourselves in this way within a narrow circle, we may,
indeed, with a greater degree of facility excel in many
parts; but even here the great secret of being superior
in any one of them, is that of possessing but a mediocrity
in the others.</p>

<p>Let us take, for example, the sciences, which bring
into action the functions of the brain. We have seen
that these functions relate especially to the memory,
which presides over nomenclature; to the imagination,
under the empire of which, is poetry; to the attention,
which is chiefly excited by the details of calculation; and
to the judgment, whose dominion embraces the whole
of the sciences of reasoning. Now it is manifest from
daily observation, that not one of these different operations
of the mind is to be developed but at the expense
of the others.</p>

<p>The habits of reciting the beauties of Corneille or
Racine, we might naturally suppose would enlarge the
mind of the actor; what can be the reason that from such
habit he does not acquire an energy of conception beyond
that of the vulgar? The reason depends in part, no doubt,
upon the natural disposition of the man, but at the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
time may be deduced from the greater efforts of memory,
and the faculty of imitation, which such a person is obliged
to exert: for the purpose of enriching these, the other
parts of the brain are in a manner plundered.</p>

<p>Accordingly, when I perceive an individual, desirous
at the same time of excelling by address of hand, in the
operations of surgery, by depth of judgment in the practice
of medicine, by extent of memory in botany, and
by force of attention in metaphysical contemplation,
methinks I see a physician, who, for healing a disease, for
the purpose of expelling, according to the old expression,
the morbific humour, at the same time undertakes to
augment the whole of the secretions by the simultaneous
use of sialagogues, diuretics, sudorifics, emmenagogues,
&amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>But would not the slightest acquaintance with the laws
of the economy, suffice for hinting to such physician,
that one gland pours forth a greater quantity of fluid,
only because the others secrete a less? Should he not
know that such a variety of medicines can operate in
no decided way, and that to exact too much of nature,
is frequently the means of obtaining nothing? The same
may be asked of the individual who is desirous of simultaneous
perfection, both in the bodily and mental exercises,
who should pretend to double or triple his relative
life, when nature has willed that he should only have the
power of detaching from some few of his organs, some
few degrees of force, which may be added to one or more
of his other organs, and by no means that of increasing
the sum of these powers.</p>

<p>Do we wish that any one organ in particular shall
attain to perfection, we must condemn the others to
inaction. We castrate men to change their voices; it is
astonishing that the barbarous idea of depriving them<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of sight has not been found out also for the purpose of
rendering them musicians, since it is well known how
acute the sense of hearing is in the blind. The child,
who should be destined to music, ceteris paribus, would
make a much more rapid progress, were his ears to be
assailed by harmonious sounds only, and every thing
removed which might be capable of exercising his other
senses.</p>

<p>It is a truth, then, that our superiority in such or such
an art and science, may almost always be measured by
our inferiority in other respects; and that this general
maxim which the greater number of the ancient philosophers
have insisted on, but which many of our modern
ones would willingly overturn, has for its foundation one
of the great laws of the animal economy, and will ever
be as immutable as the base on which it rests.</p>


<h4>VI. <em>Of the education of the animal life as to duration.</em></h4>

<p>The education of the organs of the animal life, is prolonged
for a time which we cannot determine, as it is
influenced by such a variety of circumstances; but the
peculiarity of this education consists in its being the business
of each age, to bring to perfection certain organs in
particular.</p>

<p>In childhood, the senses more especially are educated;
every thing seems to relate to the development of their
functions. Environed with bodies which are new to
him, the little individual seeks to know them all; he
maintains in a sort of perpetual expectation those organs
by which his connexions with what is near him are
established, and undoubtedly his sensibility is excessively
developed. His nervous compared with his muscular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
system, is proportionally very great; accordingly for the
dissection of the nerves, we always prefer the bodies of
children.</p>

<p>With the education of the senses, the improvement of
the functions of the brain which relate to sensation is
necessarily connected. In proportion, then, as the sum
of the sensations becomes enlarged, the memory and
imagination begin to come into play. The age which
follows infancy, is that of the education of those parts of
the brain in which these faculties are seated.&mdash;It is then,
that there have existed a sufficient number of antecedent
sensations for the exercise of the memory, and for the
discovery of the type of those illusory sensations which
it is the business of the imagination to assemble. On the
other hand, the little activity of the judgment at this
epoch is much in favour of the energy of these two
faculties; and then the revolution which puberty brings
on, the taste which it develops, and the desires which it
creates, contribute very much to extend the sphere of the
latter of them.</p>

<p>When perception, memory, and the imagination have
been perfected, when their education is finished, that of
the judgment commences, or rather becomes more active,
for the judgment begins to be exercised upon the very
first materials, with which it is presented. At this epoch
the functions of the senses, and partly those of the brain
have nothing more to acquire, and all the powers of the
individual, are concentrated upon the education of the
judgment.</p>

<p>Hence it is manifest, that the first portion of the animal
life, or that by means of which we are acted on from
without, and reflect such action, has at each age a division,
which is then particularly unfolded. The first age
is that of the education of the senses, the second that of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
the enlargement of the imagination, the third that of the
development of the judgment.</p>

<p>We should never then prescribe the study of the
sciences, which exact the exercise of the judgment, at an
age when the senses are especially in action; but follow
in our artificial methods of education, the same laws
which preside over the natural education of the organs.
The child should be applied to music and design; the
adolescent, to the sciences of nomenclature, and the belles
lettres; the adult, to the exacter sciences, where facts are
connected by a process of reasoning. The study of logic
and the mathematics, terminated our ancient plan of education;
it was one advantage at least among its numerous
imperfections.</p>

<p>As to the second portion of the animal life, or that by
means of which the animal reacts upon external bodies,
the state of infancy is characterized by the number, the
frequency, and feebleness of its motions; adult age by
their vigour; and adolescence by a mixture of the two.
The voice, however, does not appear to follow these proportions,
but is subject to an influence which proceeds
especially from the organs of generation.</p>

<p>I shall not dwell upon the different modifications,
which with respect to the animal life are derived from
sex, climate, and season. So many have treated of these
questions, that it would be difficult to add to what has
been said upon them.</p>

<p>In speaking of the laws of education, as they affect the
organs of the external life, I have supposed these organs
to be in a state of complete integrity, and possessed of
whatever is necessary to their perfection.&mdash;If they be
feeble or delicate, if any defect of conformation exist in
them, these laws will only be applicable more or less;
for it is manifest that the habit of judging will not rectify<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
the judgment, if the brain be badly constituted; and that
the frequent exercise of the larynx and voluntary muscles,
will never make up for the irregularity of action occasioned
by irregularity of conformation.</p>

elsewhere; <em>the touch is the sense of reason</em>. It is undoubtedly a
delightful prerogative; but let us see if it is incontestable. And first
does the touch never deceive us? All children know an experiment
which proves the contrary. If we cross two fingers of the same hand,
and place in the angular space between their extremities a small body
which touches both of them, the touch will give the sensation of two
distinct bodies. It is then true that the touch may become a cause of
errors; it no doubt serves to rectify those of the other senses, but do
not these in their turn often defend us from the errors of the touch? If
the sight were not almost constantly in exercise, the errors of touch
would be much more numerous; we can judge of them by what we
experience when we are in the dark. If we were to take from one
man the use of his eyes, and from another that of his hands and the
exercise of touch as much as possible, we should see which would be
the most embarrassed, which would make the most false judgments.</p></div>

the motions of the lungs should be accelerated? Undoubtedly not;
besides, the acceleration is not successive in these two functions, as
Bichat seems to imply. The one is the necessary and immediate consequence
of the other. But why does the action of the heart increase
in this second period of digestion? We cannot tell; nor do we know
why it diminishes in the first; for to think of explaining it by saying

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_IX" id="CHAPTER_IX"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER IX.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="fs50">OF THE ORIGIN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORGANIC LIFE.</span></h3>


<p>We have just now seen that the animal life, which is
inactive in the fœtus, is developed after birth: we have
also followed up the particular laws of its development.
On the contrary, the organic life comes into action almost
as soon as the fœtus is conceived; for as soon as the least
organization is apparent, the little heart will be seen
protruding its blood on all sides. The heart is the first
formed part, the first in action: now, as all the organic
phenomena depend upon it, we may readily conceive in
what way the functions of the inward life are thrown into
exercise.</p>


<h4>I. <em>Of the mode of the organic life in the fœtus.</em></h4>

<p>Nevertheless, the organic life of the fœtus, is not the
same as that which the adult is destined to enjoy. Let
us enquire into the reason of this difference.</p>

<p>We have said that the organic life is the result of two
great orders of functions, of those namely of assimilation
and decomposition, so as to form an habitual circle of
creation and destruction. Now in the fœtus this circle
is singularly contracted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>For in the first place, the functions of assimilation are
much fewer in number; the molecules before they arrive
within the organs which they are destined to create, are
not submitted to so many actions; they penetrate the
fœtus already elaborated by the digestion, circulation,
and respiration of the mother. Instead of traversing the
apparatus of the digestive organs, which at this age appear
to be almost inactive, they enter at once into the system
of the circulation; the road which they have travelled is
less, it is not requisite that they should be presented to
the influence of respiration; and accordingly the fœtus
of the mammalia has in its preliminary organization a
near analogy with that of the adult reptile, in which but
a small part of the blood at its issuing from the heart, is
sent into the vessels of the lungs.<a name="FNanchor_48_48" id="FNanchor_48_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>The molecules of nourishment in this way pass almost
directly from the circulating torrent into the nutritive
system. The general process of assimilation, then, is
much less complicated than that of the following age.</p>

<p>On the other hand, those functions which habitually
decompose the organs, which clear the system of substances
already become injurious and foreign to its nature,
are at this age but very inactive. Neither the pulmonary
exhalation, nor sweating, nor transpiration have as yet
commenced: the bile, urine, and saliva are but small in
quantity, if compared with what they are destined at a
future time to be, so that the portion of blood from which
they are to be made in the adult, in the fœtus is almost
entirely expended on the system of the nutritive organs.</p>

<p>The organic system of the fœtus, then, is remarkable&mdash;on
the one hand, for the extreme promptitude of its
assimilation, a promptitude depending on the very small
number of the functions concurring to that end; and on
the other, for the extreme inertia of its decomposition,
an inertia depending on the little activity of the different
functions, which are the agents of this great process.</p>

<p>It is easy from the foregoing considerations to account
for the rapidity which characterizes the growth of the
fœtus; a rapidity which is manifestly out of all proportion
with that which takes place at any other age. Indeed,
while every thing is in favour of the progression of
the nutritive matter towards the parts where it is destined
to be put down, every thing at the same time seems to
oblige such matter to remain in the place where it has
been deposited, the emunctories of the system being
wanting.</p>

<p>To the great simplicity of assimilation in the fœtus,
we may add the great activity of the organs which contribute
to it an activity, which depends upon the more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span>
considerable sum of vital power which they then partake.
All the powers of the economy, indeed, appear to be
concentrated upon the system of the circulation and nutrition;
the functions of digestion, respiration, secretion and
exhalation, are exercised but obscurely.<a name="FNanchor_49_49" id="FNanchor_49_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a></p>

<p>If we now observe that the organs of the animal life,
which are condemned to a necessary inaction, are the seat
at the same time of a very small portion only of vital
power (the surplus of this being thrown upon the organic
life) it will be easy to perceive, that almost the whole of
the powers which are afterwards to be developed upon the
two systems in general, will be then concentrated upon
those which serve to nourish and compose the different
parts of the fœtus, and that in consequence the functions
which concur to the process of nutrition and growth, must
at that age be the seat of an extreme energy.</p>


<h4>II. <em>Development of the organic life after birth.</em></h4>

<p>Immediately after birth, the organic life of the child has
a great addition made to it; its extent is almost doubled,
for not only are many of the functions which did not
before exist at such time added, but those which existed
previously are much enlarged. Now in this remarkable
revolution of things, a law directly the contrary of that
which presides over the animal life is observed; for the
organs of this life, whether they be newly brought into
exercise, or simply receive an increase of action, need
no education; they suddenly attain to a perfection, which
those of the animal life do not acquire, otherwise than by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
long habitude. A rapid glance upon the development of
this life, will be sufficient to convince us of the truth of
the above observation.</p>

<p>At the instant of birth, digestion and respiration, with
a great part of the exhalations and absorptions commence.
Now after the first inspirations and expirations; after the
elaboration in the stomach of the first milk, which is
taken in by the infant, as soon as the exhalants of the
lungs and the skin have once rejected some small portions
of their respective fluids, the respiratory, the digestive
and exhalant organs, have as perfect an action as they ever
will have.</p>

<p>At the same time all the glands, which slept as it were,
which poured forth but a very small quantity of fluid, are
awakened from their torpor by the stimuli of the various
substances which are applied to the mouths of their excretory
ducts. The passage of the milk at the extremities
of the stenonian and wartonian ducts, of the chyme at the
end of the choledochus and the pancreatic duct, the contact
of air with the orifice of the urethra, awaken into
action the salivary glands, the pancreas, the liver, and the
kidneys. The air in like manner upon the inner surface
of the trachea and the nostrils, and the aliments upon
that of the digestive passages, are the excitants which
rouse these parts into action.<a name="FNanchor_50_50" id="FNanchor_50_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span></p>

<p>It is then also that begin the various excretions of the
system: now if we examine well the different organs
which concur to the above mentioned phenomena, we
shall find that they require no sort of education.</p>

<p>I shall not inquire into the reason of this difference in
the development of the two lives. I shall only observe
that it is out of the power of any one of the inward
organs, to acquire a marked degree of superiority over
any other, for the same reason that they all of them attain,
immediately upon entering into action, as great a perfection
as at any time they are destined to possess.</p>

<p>Nevertheless there is nothing more common than the
predominance of one system of the organic life over the
other systems; this is sometimes the vascular, sometimes
the pulmonary apparatus, at other times the organs of
digestion, and the liver especially, have the greater degree
of development, and decide on the particular temperament
of the individual; but the cause of this sort of
constitution depends on primitive organization, on the
structure of the parts, on their conformation. Such superiority
is by no means the effect of exercise or habit, for
the fœtus and the child display the same phenomena, in
as much reality though less apparently indeed, than
adolescence, or manhood.</p>

<p>In the same way, the debility of any particular system
of the internal functions, may depend either on original
constitution, or on some accidental vice or disease, by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
which, while the others have remained untouched, its
constitution may have been impaired.</p>

<p>Such then is the great difference of the two lives of
the animal, with respect to inequality of perfection in the
organs. In the animal life, the predominance or inferiority
of one system, with relation to the others, depends
almost entirely upon its activity or inertia, on its habitude
of acting or not acting. In the organic life on the contrary,
such states are immediately connected with the
texture of the organs, and never with their education.</p>

<p>From hence also we have the reason why physical
temperament, and moral character, are not susceptible of
change from education, which so prodigiously modifies
the actions of the animal life, for as we have seen, they
both of them belong to the organic life.</p>

<p>The character is, if I may so express myself, the physiognomy
of passions; temperament, that of the internal
functions: now the one and the other being at all ages
the same, having a direction which habitude and exercise
can never alter, it is manifest that they must ever be
withdrawn from the influence of education. The violence
of the temperament may indeed be moderated, for
the powers of the judgment, and reflection may be augmented,
and the animal life strengthened in such way
as to give it a capacity of resisting the impulses of the
organic life; but to attempt an immediate alteration of
the character, or of the passions, which are its habitual
expressions, is an enterprise analogous to that of the
physician, who should attempt to elevate or depress, (and
that, for the entire life of the patient,) the ordinary contracting
powers of the heart and arteries.</p>

<p>We should observe to such physician, that the circulation
and respiration, are not under the dominion of the
will; and that they cannot be modified excepting in passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
into a state of disease. The same observation might
be made to those, who imagine that the character, and
consequently the passions may be modified.</p>

<p><a name="Footnote_48_48" id="Footnote_48_48"></a><a href="#FNanchor_48_48"><span class="label">[48]</span></a> I am persuaded that the still very obscure theory of the fœtus might
be elucidated by that of animals who have a similar organization. For
example, in the frog, in whom but little blood goes through the lungs,
the heart is a simple organ, with a single auricle and ventricle; there
is a communication or rather continuity between the two systems,
venous and arterial, whilst in the mammalia, the vessels in which the
red blood circulates do not communicate with those which carry the
black blood, except it be by the capillaries.
</p>
<p>
In the fœtus, the foramen ovale and the ductus arteriosus also render
very evidently the arteries and veins continuous; in the fœtus the heart
is likewise a simple organ, not forming, notwithstanding its partitions,
but one cavity whilst it is double after birth. The two kinds of blood
mix at this period, as in reptiles. Now, I shall prove hereafter, that in
the child who has breathed, this mixture would soon be fatal; that the
black blood, circulating in the arteries, would very quickly produce
asphyxia in the animal. Whence arises then this difference? It cannot
be studied in the fœtus; it is necessary perhaps to search for it in frogs,
salamanders and other reptiles, which can, by their organization, be a
long time deprived of air without dying, a phenomenon which approximates
them to the mammalia while living in the womb of the mother.
Till these very important researches are made, the history of respiration
will be incomplete.</p></div>

to the contact of the air, and soon the kidneys begin to secrete; then
it is the impression of the air on the urethra that has produced their

air in the other an accidental and purely accessory circumstance? Do
we believe, that if by any cause the opening of the prepuce was
entirely obliterated, the secretion of urine would be prevented? Do
we not know that if instead of taking into the mouth savoury food, it
is brought near to it, the saliva flows not less, or in vulgar language
the mouth waters? There is however no contact, there is not any

<h3><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER X.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="fs50">OF THE NATURAL TERMINATION OF THE TWO LIVES.</span></h3>


<p>We have just now seen, that the two lives commence
at distant epochs; we have seen them developing themselves
according to laws, which are exactly the reverse
of each other. I shall now attempt to describe them, as
they terminate; and this they do in a very different manner
also, assuming characters at such time as distinct and
separate, as those which they possess during the periods
of their activity. In this place, I shall speak of natural
death only; those deaths, which originate in accidental
causes, will be the object of the second part of this work.</p>


<h4>I. <em>In Natural Death the animal life is the first to cease.</em></h4>

<p>Natural death is remarkable for the following reason
chiefly:&mdash;it terminates the animal life, a long time before
it puts an end to the organic life.</p>

<p>He who dies in consequence of a very prolonged old
age, dies in detail; his exterior functions are finished,
one after the other; the senses are shut up successively;
the ordinary causes of sensation pass over them, and do
not affect them.</p>

<p>The sight grows dull and confused; it ceases at length
to transmit the images of objects: this is the blindness of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
old age; sounds also, after a certain time, affect the ear
confusedly; the organ at last becomes entirely insensible.
The cutaneous covering of the body grows hard and dry;
it is the seat of an obscure and imperfect touch. Besides
which, the habitude of feeling has blunted the power of
feeling; at the same time all the other organs which are
dependent on the skin, grow weak and perish; the hair
falls, it is deprived of the juices by which it was nourished:
to continue our description, odours make but a feeble
impression upon the nostrils.</p>

<p>The taste indeed is a little more kept up; but let it be
remarked that this sense is connected with the organic as
much as with the animal life, and is therefore necessary
to the internal functions: In this way, when all agreeable
sensations have fled the old man, when their absence
has already broken in part the connexions, which attach
him to the world, his taste remains with him still; it is
the last thread to which is suspended the pleasure of existence.</p>

<p>In this way, isolated in the midst of nature, already
deprived of the greater number of the functions of the
sensitive organs, the old man is soon to suffer the loss of
the common action of the brain, for it is manifest, that
there can scarcely be any farther perception, for the very
reason that there is nothing farther coming from the
senses. Meanwhile, the imagination lessens and is soon
annihilated.</p>

<p>The memory of present things is destroyed: the old
man in an instant forgets what is told him, because his
external senses enfeebled and already dead, as it were,
in no wise confirm what is intimated to him by the mind
alone. Ideas escape him when the images, which are
traced by the senses, do not keep their hold. On the
contrary, the remembrance of the past remains with him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
that which the old man has formerly known, has been
taught him or at least confirmed to him by his senses.<a name="FNanchor_51_51" id="FNanchor_51_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a></p>

<p>He differs from the child in this respect; the child
judges only from the sensations which he experiences,
the old man from those, which he has experienced.</p>

<p>The result of the two states is the same, for the judgment
is equally uncertain, whether founded exclusively
upon actual or past sensation. Its accuracy depends upon
the due comparison of the two. No one can be ignorant,
that in the judgment which we form from visible
objects, the actual impression would frequently deceive
us, were we not to rectify the error by what we are
enabled to recollect, and may we not observe that past
sensations, in a short time grow confused, if the features
of the picture, which they have left with us, be not
retraced by new and analogous impressions?</p>

<p>The present then, and the past with regard to sensation,
are equally necessary for the perfection of the judgment.
If either the one or the other be wanting there cannot
be any comparison made between the two, and in consequence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>
there must be a want of precision in the judgment.</p>

<p>For these reasons, the first and the latter ages of man,
are equally remarkable for imbecility. Old age is second
infancy. The two periods of life resemble each other
with regard to want of judgment; they differ only as to
the cause of such defect.</p>

<p>The interruption of the functions of the brain of the
old man, is a consequence of the almost entire annihilation
of the sensitive system with him; in the same way
does the weakness of the locomotive power, succeed
almost inevitably to the inactivity of the brain. This
organ in fact re-acts upon the muscles, in proportion only
as the senses act upon it.</p>

<p>The movements of the old man are few and tardy; he
changes with difficulty the attitude, into which he has
thrown himself; seated near the fire, and concentrated
within himself, a stranger to every thing without him,
he passes his days there, deprived of desire, of passion,
and sensation; speaking little because he is determined
by nothing to break his silence, yet happy in feeling that
he still exists, when almost every other sentiment is
gone.</p>

<p>The rigidity of the muscles however, and the diminution
of their contracting powers, is another cause of
inactivity in the old man, and doubtless has its influence;
but it is by no means the principal one, since the
heart and the muscular fibres of the intestines, contract
the same rigidity, and are deprived of their powers of
moving, in a very different way from that, in which the
voluntary muscles lose it. With the voluntary muscles,
it is not so much the power as the excitant of the power
which is lost. If it were possible to compose a man
with the senses and brain of old age, and the muscles of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
youth, the voluntary motions of such man, would hardly
be more developed for the reasons which I have given.</p>

<p>From the above it is easy to see that the external functions
of the old man are extinguished by degrees, and
that his animal life has almost entirely ceased, while his
organic life is still in activity. Under this consideration,
the state of the animal about to suffer a natural death, is
nearly similar to that of the fœtus in utero, or of the
vegetable which lives within itself only, and for which
external nature is absolutely silent.</p>

<p>If we now recollect that sleep entrenches more than
a third upon the duration of the animal life, if we add
to this the total absence of such life for the first nine
months of existence, and its almost entire inactivity
during the latter period of existence, it will be easy to
calculate the great disproportion of its duration, when
compared with that of the organic life which is exercised
uninterruptedly.</p>

<p>But wherefore when we have ceased to exist without,
do we continue to exist within, since our sensations and
above all, our powers of locomotion, are especially destined
to place us in relation with those substances, which are
to nourish us. Wherefore are those functions enfeebled
in a greater disproportion than the internal functions,
and why is there no exact relation in the times of their
cessation.</p>

<p>I cannot entirely resolve this question. I shall only
observe that society has an especial influence in creating
this difference; for man in the midst of his fellow-creatures
makes a very great use of his animal life; the
springs of it are habitually more fatigued than those of
his organic life, and worn away under the influence of
society; the eye by artificial light, the ear by sounds too
frequently repeated, and above all by those of speech,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
which are wanting to other animals;<a name="FNanchor_52_52" id="FNanchor_52_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> the smell in like
manner is debilitated by factitious odours, the taste by
savours, which certainly are not natural, the touch and
the tact by constant attrition of dress,<a name="FNanchor_53_53" id="FNanchor_53_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> and the brain by
too incessant thinking.</p>

<p>We live then externally with excess. We abuse our
animal life; it is circumscribed by nature within limits
which are too much enlarged by us for its duration; thus
it cannot be surprising that it should cease so soon. In
fact we have seen the vital powers divided into two
orders, the one appertaining to this life, the other to the
organic life. These two orders may be compared to two
lights which burn at the same time, and which have only
a determined quantity of materials for aliment. In which
case, if the one be agitated by a stronger wind than the
other is, it must necessarily be the sooner extinguished.</p>

<p>Yet social influence notwithstanding is very advantageous
to man. It gradually disengages him from those
bonds which attach him to life, and renders the instant of
death less terrible.</p>

<p>The idea of our last hour, is painful only because it
puts an end to our animal life. The borders of the tomb
are beset with terrors, which will all be found to originate
in the thought of such privation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span></p>

<p>It is not the pain of death, which we fear; how many
dying men are there for whom the gift of existence would
be precious, though purchased at the expense of an uninterrupted
series of suffering! If we look at the animal
which lives but little externally, he by no means trembles
at beholding the instant of his death.<a name="FNanchor_54_54" id="FNanchor_54_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a></p>

<p>Were it possible to suppose a man, who in dying
should lose his internal functions only, such man would
look upon his death with an indifferent eye, because he
would feel that the blessings of existence, are attached
to the powers of feeling the influence of nature and
society.</p>

<p>If the animal life then be terminated gradually, if each
of the bonds by which we are capable of the pleasures of
living, be broken by little and little, such pleasures will
escape us imperceptibly, and the old man will have forgotten
the value of life, when it is about to be taken from
him; such destruction will resemble that of the vegetable
only.</p>


<h4>II. <em>The Organic Life in natural death does not terminate
as it does in accidental death.</em></h4>

<p>The organic life remains with the old man after the
almost total loss of his animal life, and terminates in a
very different manner from that which is exemplified in
the case of violent and sudden death. The latter has
two periods, the first of which is marked by the sudden
cessation of respiration and the circulation, the second<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
by the slow and gradual extinction of the other organic
functions.</p>

<p>The parietes of the stomach, for instance, continue to
act upon the aliment which may be found there, the juices
of the stomach continue to dissolve it. The experiments
of the English and Italian physicians upon absorption,
(experiments the whole of which I have repeated) have
proved that this function not unfrequently remains in a
state of activity, after the general death of the body, and
if not as long as some have supposed, at least for a very
considerable interval. Discharges of urine and feces are
often observed to take place many hours after sudden
death.</p>

<p>The process of nutrition also continues to be manifest
in the hair and in the nails; the same would doubtless be
the case in all the other parts, as well as in the secretions,
could we observe the insensible movements of which their
functions are the result. The heart of the frog being
taken away, the capillary circulation may still be seen
under the influence of the tonic powers. The body is
very slow also in losing its animal heat.<a name="FNanchor_55_55" id="FNanchor_55_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span></p>

<p>I might augment the above observations with a number
of others, which would go to prove the same assertions; on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
the contrary, in the death which is the effect of old age,
the whole of the functions cease, because they have each
of them been successively extinguished. The vital powers
abandon each organ by degrees, digestion languishes,
the secretions and the absorptions are finished, the capillary
secretions become embarrassed; lastly, the general
circulation is suppressed. The heart is the ultimum
moriens.</p>

<p>Such, then, is the great difference which distinguishes
the death of the old man, from that which is the effect of
a sudden blow. In the one, the powers of life begin to
be extinguished in all the parts, and cease at the heart;
the body dies from the circumference towards the centre:
in the other, life becomes extinct at the heart, and afterwards
in the parts. The phenomena of death are seen
extending themselves from the centre to the circumference.</p>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_51_51" id="Footnote_51_51"></a><a href="#FNanchor_51_51"><span class="label">[51]</span></a> If the old man preserves with difficulty the memory of the most
recent events, whilst he often retraces with the greatest ease the recollection
of the most distant ones, it is not because the first have been
more faithfully transmitted to him by his senses, but because these
events had produced a greater impression on him. This is so true, that
failure of the memory is sometimes remarked in old people who have
their senses in perfection. On the other hand, very imperfect sensations
may produce a very lively impression. A connoisseur in painting,
when his sight is very bad, experiences in seeing a beautiful picture, a
hundred times more pleasure, than one who is indifferent to it, though
he examines it with good eyes, and the connoisseur preserves the image
of it long after the other has lost it. We do not perceive the recollection
of things, unless there is some circumstance connected with them
that makes a lively impression; but in the same event, this circumstance
will not be the same in all individuals, and it is sometimes by
the most trifling of all that a man fixes the fact in his memory.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_52_52" id="Footnote_52_52"></a><a href="#FNanchor_52_52"><span class="label">[52]</span></a> This failure of the senses appears in animals as well as man, and
it may be observed in those whom we suffer to grow old among us.
We often see dogs becoming blind and deaf; and these infirmities are
perhaps more common in them than in man. But as these animals
are rarely permitted to arrive at extreme old age, we have not often an
opportunity of observing them.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_53_53" id="Footnote_53_53"></a><a href="#FNanchor_53_53"><span class="label">[53]</span></a> By defending the skin from the shock of external bodies, and by
preserving it from the variation of temperature, dress very certainly
preserves its sensibility, and far from impairing the sense of touch, as
Bichat maintains, it acts as a circumstance favourable to its preservation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_54_54" id="Footnote_54_54"></a><a href="#FNanchor_54_54"><span class="label">[54]</span></a> The animal no doubt does not tremble at the moment of death;
for he does not see it. His present sensation is every thing to him. If
he suffers at the approach of death, he shows it by the usual signs; but
it is only the present pain that he expresses, he sees nothing beyond.
The child is in this respect, in the same situation as the animal.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_55_55" id="Footnote_55_55"></a><a href="#FNanchor_55_55"><span class="label">[55]</span></a> In order to ascertain the cause of the differences in the cooling
of the body after the various kinds of death, it is necessary to examine
what general conditions can have an influence in the cooling of a body
left to itself. Of these there are three principal ones.
</p>
<p>
Under the same external circumstances, a body will cool so much the
slower. 1st. As its temperature at the beginning of the experiment,
shall be higher in relation to that of surrounding bodies; 2d. As its
surface shall be less in relation to its size; 3d. And as its exterior parts
shall be less perfect conductors of heat.
</p>
<p>
In order to see how the first condition is modified in different cases,
it is necessary to recollect what is the source of animal heat. The
blood is warmed in passing through the lungs in consequence of the
chemical phenomena of respiration; and as from the lungs it is carried
to all parts of the body, it yields to the different organs a portion of
the heat which it has received. Hence the general temperature of the
body will be higher in proportion to the temperature of the blood, to
the frequency with which this fluid is renewed in the organs and to
the quantity of it that is brought to them, at each pulsation.
</p>
<p>
Now in diseases of long duration, the volume of blood is considerably
diminished, the activity of the heart is lessened, and respiration is performed
in an imperfect manner. Thus the body of the patient who
sinks under these circumstances has less heat to lose than that of the
man who dies suddenly, when all these functions were performed in
perfection.
</p>
<p>
Let us pass now to the second condition. The cooling, as we have
said, takes place so much the quicker as the surface of the body is the
more extended in proportion to its size; now, in the emaciation which
accompanies almost all diseases that are protracted, the size decreases
much more rapidly than the surface. Thus then, when even at the
moment of death the general temperature of the body may be as high as
in a state of health, the cooling would however take place more quickly.
</p>
<p>
It remains for us now only to examine under what circumstances the
third condition is fulfilled in the most advantageous manner. When
an individual in full health dies, the sub-cutaneous cellular texture
usually contains a greater or less quantity of fat. Now we know that
it is one of the characters of all fat substances to be very bad conductors
of heat. Hence then a third reason which should render cooling
more slow after sudden deaths. Sometimes after a disease, this last
condition is fulfilled in another manner. In certain derangements of
the circulation, the cellular texture is filled with serum; and as all
aqueous fluids are bad conductors of caloric, though the temperature
of the body may not be very high at the moment of death, the heat is
yet preserved for a long time.
</p>
<p>
To the different causes which we have just mentioned, there is sometimes
added another which is peculiar to one kind of sudden death.
It is observed that in the midst of the same external circumstances,
the blood does not always cool with the same quickness, and that in
proportion as its coagulation is slower, its heat is longer preserved.
Now, it is a well known fact, that when death is the result of asphyxia,
the vessels are found full of fluid blood; this is also a reason which
contributes to explain the slowness of the cooling. And it should be
remarked, that asphyxia is one of the most frequent causes of sudden
death either accidental or voluntary.</p></div></div>

<span class="lht2 fs70">GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS ON DEATH.</span></h3>


<p>In the first part of this work, I have explained the
two great divisions of life, together with the remarkable
differences, which distinguish the animal existing without,
from the animal existing within. I have discussed the
characters which are exclusively proper to the two lives,
and the particular laws, according to which they both of
them commence, are developed and end in the natural
order.</p>

<p>In this second part I shall inquire in what way they
accidentally finish, in what way their course is prematurely
arrested.</p>

<p>The influence of society suffers us but rarely to live
out the period which was intended us by nature; while
almost every other animal attains his natural end, such
end in the human species is become a sort of phenomenon.
The different kinds then of accidental death, should engage
the particular attention of the physician and physiologist.
Now this sort of death may happen in two ways: sometimes
it is the result of great disturbance excited in the
economy; and sometimes it is the effect of disease.</p>

<p>In general it is easy enough to discover, according to
what laws the functions are terminated in consequence of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
any violent or sudden attack; of apoplexy, for instance,
great hemorrhagy, concussion of the brain, or asphyxia;
because in such cases the organs of the body, excepting
that which is immediately affected, are not the seat of
any peculiar lesion, and cease to act from causes diametrically
the contrary of those, which according to the common
course of things maintain them in action. Now as
these causes are partly known, their contraries may be
inferred; besides, we are capable of imitating these sorts
of death upon animals, and consequently of analyzing,
experimentally, their different phenomena.</p>

<p>On the other hand it is seldom in our power to produce
artificially in the bodies of animals the diseases of the
human species. Were we even possessed of such power,
we should gain but little knowledge from it: the laws of
life in fact are so changed, so modified, so altered in their
very nature, by the various morbid affections to which
the parts are subject, that but very seldom can we depart
from the known phenomena of the living animal, when
we undertake to inquire into those which it exhibits
in its dying moments. For such inquiries it would be
necessary to know what is that intermediate state between
health and death, in which the functions experience so
remarkable a change; a change, which has such infinite
varieties, and produces such innumerable sorts of disease.
But, where shall we find the physician, who will assert
that from the actual data of his art, he understands in
such intermediate state, the profoundly hidden operations
of nature?</p>

<p>In these researches then, we shall occupy ourselves
more especially on those sorts of death which I first
enumerated. Those, which have been mentioned in the
preceding paragraph will engage us only now and then:
besides, at my age I cannot be supposed to have acquired<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
a sufficient degree of medical knowledge to treat of them
with advantage.</p>

<p>The first remark, which the observation of the different
kinds of sudden death suggests, is, that in all of them the
organic life to a certain point may subsist, the animal life
being extinct; but that the latter is entirely dependent,
and lasts not for a moment after the interruption of the
former. The individual, who is struck with apoplexy
may live internally for many days after the stroke, externally
he is dead. In this case death commences with the
animal life: if on the contrary it exerts its influence in
the first place upon any of the essential organic functions&mdash;as
on the circulation in wounds or on respiration
in the asphyxiæ&mdash;the animal life is gone at once, together
with the sensible actions of the organic life.</p>

<p>The red and warm-blooded animal, loses his external
life at the moment when he ceases to exist internally,
the cessation of the phenomena of his organic life is a
sure index of his general death; indeed the reality of
death can be pronounced only from such datum; the
interruption of the external phenomena of life is in almost
every instance fallacious.</p>

<p>On what depends this difference of the manner in
which the two lives accidentally end? It is owing to the
mode of that influence, which they exercise the one over
the other, to the kind of bond, by which they are connected.</p>

<p>This mode of influence, this bond, appears to exist
between the brain on the part of the animal life and the
lungs, or heart on the part of the organic life. The action
of one of these three organs is essentially necessary to
that of the two others; and as they constitute the three
centres, in which are terminated all the secondary phenomena
of the two lives, whenever they cease to act, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
phenomena which depend upon them must cease also, and
general death ensue.</p>

<p>Physiologists have been at all times acquainted with the
importance of this triple focus; and have given the name
of vital to all those functions, which have their seat in it.
Under the point of view which at present engages our
attention their ideas on this head are well worthy of
notice, for every species of sudden death begins by the
interruption of the circulation, the respiration, or action
of the brain. In the first place, one of the three functions
ceases, then the others successively; so that to expose
with precision the phenomena of sudden death, we must
consider them as they take place in the three principal
organs, which we have mentioned.</p>

<p>We shall first inquire into those deaths, which begin
at the heart, and afterwards into those, which begin in
the lungs and in the brain. I shall explain in what way,
when one of these organs is affected, the others die; and
then demonstrate by what sort of mechanism the death
of the various other parts of the body ensues. Lastly I
shall determine from the principles, which I shall then
have laid down, the nature of the different species of
disease, which are peculiar to the heart, the lungs, and
the brain.</p>

<br />
<span class="fs50">OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE DEATH OF THE HEART, OVER
THAT OF THE BRAIN.</span></h3>


<p>I shall evidently have determined what is the mode of
this influence, should I be enabled to establish in what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
way the action of the heart is necessary to that of the
brain; for in this instance the cause of death will be no
other than the privation of the cause of life. Now the
heart can only act upon the brain in two ways; by the
nerves, or the vessels which serve as their connecting
medium. In fact these two organs have no other means
of communication.</p>

<p>It is evident that the nerves cannot be the agents of
such actions; it is the province of the brain to act by
means of the nerves. The different parts of the body
never influence the brain by such means, excepting in
the sympathies. If a bundle of nerves belonging to the
voluntary muscles be tied, the muscles indeed will cease
to act, but nothing will be changed in the cerebral
mass.<a name="FNanchor_56_56" id="FNanchor_56_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a></p>

<p>I have ascertained by many experiments that the phenomena
of galvanism, which are propagated so energetically
from the brain towards the organs, which descend,
if I may so express myself, along the nerve, will hardly
ascend in a contrary direction. Apply the apparatus to
a nerve of the loins and the muscles of the upper limbs,
and when the communication is made, there will be
scarcely any contraction; but on the establishment of a
communication between the same nerve and the lower
limbs, a violent convulsive motion will instantly be occasioned.
I have even observed, on placing two metallic
plates, the one under the lumbar nerves, and the other
under the upper limbs, that the communication of the
two plates by means of a third metal, will cause a contraction<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
of the lower limbs, while the upper limbs remain
inactive, or move but feeble.<a name="FNanchor_57_57" id="FNanchor_57_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a></p>

<p>These experiments are particularly applicable to the
relation of the heart with the brain; for not only is it true
that the section, ligature or compression of the cardiac
nerves are of little effect with regard to the functions of
the latter, but it is true also, as we shall presently see,
that they do not directly modify the movements of the
former. We may conclude that the vessels are the exclusive
agents of the influence of the heart upon the brain.</p>

<p>The vessels, as every one knows, are of two sorts&mdash;venous
or arterial&mdash;they carry black or red blood, the
latter answer to the left side, the former to the right side
of the heart. Now their functions being very different,
the action of one of the portions of this organ on the
brain, can never be the same as that of the other portion.
We shall inquire in what way they both of them act
upon it.</p>

<p>In naming these two portions, I shall not make use of
the expressions of right and left to distinguish them, but
of those of the red-blooded and the black-blooded heart,
for each of these portions of itself is an isolated organ,
distinct from that to which it is applied, and in the adult
especially so. In fact there are two hearts, the one arterial,
the other venous, notwithstanding which, we can
hardly employ these adjectives for the purpose of designating
them, since they both alike possess their arterial and
venous appendages. On the other hand, they are neither
of them situated exactly to the right or to the left, are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
neither of them exactly forwards or backwards. Besides
which these latter denominations would not apply to
animals.</p>


<h4>I. <em>In what way does the cessation of the functions of
the red-blooded heart interrupt the functions of the
brain?</em></h4>

<p>The red-blooded ventricle and auricle, exert their influence
upon the brain by means of the fluid which they
send thither through the carotid and vertebral arteries.
This fluid may excite the cerebral organ in two ways.
1st. By the movement, with which it is directed. 2nd.
By the nature of its colouring principle.</p>

<p>It is easy to prove that the movement of the blood is
necessary to the life of the brain. Expose the brain of
an animal in part, and tie the carotids. In such case the
cerebral movement will be sometimes weakened, and then
the animal will be stupified, at other times the vertebral
arteries will exactly supply the place of the carotids, and
then there will be nothing deranged in the principal
functions of the brain; for there is always a relation
existing between the alternate rise and fall of the cerebral
mass, and the energy of life which it displays.<a name="FNanchor_58_58" id="FNanchor_58_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a></p>

<p>In general, the obliteration of the carotids is never
suddenly mortal. Animals will live without them, at
least for a certain time. I have kept dogs in this state<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
for several days and have afterwards made use of them
for other experiments: two however died in the course
of six hours, after the application of the ligatures.</p>

<p>After having made the above experiments which go
very far to the establishment of the principle which I am
labouring to prove, let a piece of the cranium be taken
from another animal and tie the vertebral and carotid arteries.
The movement of the brain will then be entirely
interrupted and the animal immediately die.</p>

<p>The impulse, which proceeds then from the influx of
the blood into the brain, is a condition essential to the
functions of this organ, but other proofs may be adduced,
for the establishment of the truth of this assertion.</p>

<p>1st. There are a number of compressions, which can
only act by preventing the brain from being duly affected
by such impulse. A collection of pus, or blood, will
often put a stop to all the functions, which relate to the
perception, memory, and voluntary motions of the individual.
Let such compression be removed and his sensibility
will immediately re-appear. In such case, it is
manifest that the brain was not disorganized, but only
compressed, and in a state incapable of being excited by
the heart.<a name="FNanchor_59_59" id="FNanchor_59_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a></p>

<p>I do not think it necessary on this subject to cite cases.
All authors, who have treated of wounds of the head, are
full of them. I shall content myself with remarking,
that the same effect may be artificially produced in our
experiments upon animals, and that accordingly as the
brain is compressed or free, the creature will be insensible,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
or the contrary. According to the degree of the
compression, will be the degree of the stupor.</p>

<p>2dly. There are reptiles, in the brain of which no
motion whatever is occasioned by the heart. The frog
is of this species. On raising the upper portion of the
cranium, and exposing the brain, there cannot be perceived
the slightest motion. Now in this species, and
that of the salamander, the influx of blood may be cut off
from the cerebral organ without occasioning the immediate
death of the animal. The voluntary muscles for
instance continue to act; the eyes to exhibit a lively appearance,
the tact also of the creature is manifest for some
time after the heart has been taken away, or the double
branch which proceeds from the single ventricle of these
animals has been tied.<a name="FNanchor_60_60" id="FNanchor_60_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> I have frequently repeated these
experiments, and have constantly found the effect the
same.</p>

<p>3rd. It is a general observation, that those animals
which have a long neck, and in which the heart for that
very reason is not so capable of exerting a lively influence
over the brain, have a more limited intellect, and
the cerebral functions less marked. On the contrary a
very short neck, and the approximation of the heart to
the brain very generally are found to coincide with the
latter. Similar phenomena are sometimes observed in
men. They who have the neck particularly long are
dull, they who have it short, for the most part intelligent
and lively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span></p>

<p>From these many facts we may confidently assert, that
one of the means, by which the heart maintains the brain
in action, consists in the habitual movement, which it
impresses on it.</p>

<p>But this movement is essentially different from that
which in the other viscera, such as the liver, or spleen,
is derived from the same cause. In these it is little
manifest, in the brain it is very apparent; the reason is
evident; the large arterial trunks of the brain, are situated
at its base, between the brain and its bony parietes;
in consequence of which, at each diastole, the vessels
experience a resistance from the bone, which is communicated
immediately to the cerebral mass. At such time
the brain is really lifted, just in the same way as we see a
tumour lifted by the arteries which creep along the bones
beneath it; and instances of this are frequent. So apparent
indeed is the motion of tumours when they are
situated over the carotid, as it lies upon the vertebral
column, or over the femoral artery, immediately after its
passage under the crural arch, as often to occasion doubts
with respect to their nature.</p>

<p>But no other organ is enclosed within a bony cavity;
the motion of the arteries every where else, is lost in
the surrounding cellular substance, or soft parts. Such
motion, then, is unessential to the functions of the liver,
the kidney, and other analogous viscera.</p>

<p>The integrity of the functions of the brain, is not only
dependent on the mere motion, but on the sum also of
the motion communicated. It is equally impaired by too
much, or by too little motion. Of this assertion the
following experiments are proofs.</p>

<p>1st. Inject water by the carotid of a dog; the presence
of this fluid in the brain is not pernicious, and the animal
will live very well, when the injection has been skilfully<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
made. But if it be pushed with violence, the cerebral
action will immediately be troubled, and often cannot be
restored.<a name="FNanchor_61_61" id="FNanchor_61_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> In every experiment, there will be found to
exist a relation between the force of the impulse and the
state of the brain; if the pressure be but a little augmented,
its effects will be instantly seen in the agitation of the
countenance of the creature; if relaxed, a corresponding
calm will succeed; if increased to the highest pitch, it
will immediately occasion death.</p>

<p>2dly. If the brain be exposed, and an artery afterwards
opened, so as to produce a considerable hemorrhage, the
motion of the brain will be diminished in proportion as
the afflux of the blood to it is diminished, and finally
will cease entirely. Now, according to all these various
degrees of diminution, which may be observed in the
movements of the brain, will be the corresponding weakness
of the cerebral influence as it is discoverable in the
state of the eyes, the touch, and the voluntary motion of
the animal.<a name="FNanchor_62_62" id="FNanchor_62_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a></p>

<p>Hence it is easy to see, why a state of prostration and
languor is always the consequence of great hemorrhage&mdash;and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>from what has been said above we may conceive the
reason, why the arterial system of the brain has been at
first concentrated at its base, while the larger venous
trunks are almost all of them situated on the convexity
of its surface. The base of the brain is small and easily
moved, the convexity large and little capable of transmitting
motion, such as could be made upon it by vessels.
Besides, it is at the lower part of the brain that exist its
particular and essential forms. The lesions of these are
mortal, and consequently their functions must be important.
On the contrary, experiment and observation alike
have proved, that very little derangement follows, from
cutting or rending the substance of the upper part of this
organ. Hence also we may see the reason, why its
natural defences towards its base, are constituted in such
way as to be almost impenetrable, and why at its upper
surface, it is less protected. Now, where its life is indispensable,
and its action absolutely necessary, it should
naturally receive the first and undiminished impulse of
its excitant. We may conclude, that the interruption
of the action of the red-blooded heart is the occasion of
interruption in the action of the brain by annihilating its
movement.</p>

<p>But this movement is not the only means by which
the influence of the heart is exerted on the brain; for if
it were so, we might easily reanimate the enfeebled functions
of the latter, by injecting it with water at the same
time through both the carotids. If pushed with an equal
force, the black blood and the red blood alike would be
capable of keeping up its action; but this, as we shall
presently see, is not the fact.</p>

<p>The heart, then, acts upon the brain by the nature of
the fluid which it sends thither; but as the lungs are the
focus, where the blood undergoes an alteration, we shall<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
refer the examination of its influence upon the cephalic
system, to the chapter in which we shall treat of the
relation of this system, with that of the lungs.</p>


<h4>II. <em>In what way does the cessation of the functions of
the black-blooded heart interrupt the functions of
the brain?</em></h4>

<p>It very rarely happens that general death commences
by that of the venous auricle and ventricle. On the
contrary, they are almost always the last in action, and
when they cease to act, the brain, the lungs, and the red-blooded
heart have already ceased to exhibit their respective
phenomena. Nevertheless the contraction of these
cavities may be annihilated, or rendered at least inefficacious
with regard to the circulation, from the rupture of
an aneurism or similar causes; in which case the brain
becomes inactive and dies, as we have shewn it to do in
the preceding section, from want of movement.</p>

<p>There is another kind of death of the brain depending
on the interruption of the transmission of blood from the
head to the heart, as when the jugulars are tied. The
venous system, in consequence, is glutted and the brain
compressed, from the continued afflux of the red blood
into its arteries; but the phenomena of this sort of death
are already sufficiently known.</p>

<p>In the present chapter it is my intention to examine a
species of death, the principle of which by many physiologists
has been placed in the heart, but which appears
to me to affect the head only; I mean that death which
may be occasioned by the injection of air into the
veins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>It is generally known, that as soon as any quantity of
this fluid is introduced into the vascular system, the movements
of the heart are accelerated, that the creature is
much agitated, cries with pain, is convulsed, and soon
after deprived of its animal life, but lives organically for
a certain time, and then invariably dies.<a name="FNanchor_63_63" id="FNanchor_63_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> Now, what
is the organ so readily affected by the contact of air? I
affirm it to be the brain, and not the heart; and maintain
that the circulation is annihilated, only because the
cerebral actions have previously been so.</p>

<p>For, in the first place, in this kind of death, the heart
continues to beat for some time after the cessation of the
animal life, and consequently for some time after that of
the action of the brain.<a name="FNanchor_64_64" id="FNanchor_64_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>Secondly, By injecting air into the brain through one
of the carotids, I have caused the death of the creature
just in the same way as when air is introduced into the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>veins; excepting only with a previous palpitation of the
heart.<a name="FNanchor_65_65" id="FNanchor_65_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a></p>

<p>Thirdly, Morgagni has cited a number of cases of sudden
death, the cause of which should appear, from his
remarks, to be the repletion of the blood vessels of the
brain by air, which had been developed there spontaneously,
and which he says, by its rarefaction, compressed
the origin of the nerves. I cannot suppose that such
compression can be effected by the very small quantity
of air, which, when injected into the carotid, is sufficient
to occasion death; accordingly, I should doubt whether
this compression were real in the cases adduced, but for
this, they are not the less important. Whatever be the
manner in which it kills, air is fatal whenever introduced
into the brain, and this is the essential point. It
is with the fact that we have to do and not the manner.<a name="FNanchor_66_66" id="FNanchor_66_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>Fourthly, As often as an animal is killed by the insufflation
of air into one of its veins, I have ascertained that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
the whole of the red-blooded, as well as the black-blooded
heart, is full of a frothy blood, mixed with air bubbles;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
and that the carotids, and vessels of the head, contain a
similar blood; such blood must act upon the brain, in the
same manner as it does in the two sorts of apoplexy, of
which we have just been making mention.</p>

<p>Fifthly, If air be pushed into one of the divisions of
the vena portæ from the side of the liver, it oscillates in
the greater trunks of that organ for a considerable length
of time, and arrives but slowly at the heart.&mdash;In this
instance I have observed, that the animal experiences,
only after a certain interval, those affections which are
sudden when the fluid is injected into the veins of the
principal system.<a name="FNanchor_67_67" id="FNanchor_67_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span></p>

<p>Sixthly, The rapidity with which, in certain experiments,
the annihilation of the cerebral action succeeds to
the insufflation of air into the veins, might almost persuade
us that such phenomenon is occasioned, as it is in
wounds of the heart and syncope;&mdash;but 1st. The most
simple inspection is sufficient to shew us that the heart
continues to act after the apparent death of the animal.&mdash;2dly.
As the motions of the heart are prodigiously accelerated
by the contact of the foreign fluid, they push on
the frothy blood with an extreme velocity, and hence we
have the reason, why the brain in such case is so rapidly
affected.</p>

<p>Seventhly, Were the cerebral action in this sort of
death interrupted for want of movement from the heart,
it would happen as it does in great hemorrhages of the
aorta; that is to say, without violent convulsion. But
here, on the contrary, the convulsion is extremely violent,
immediately after the injection, and consequently,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
announces the presence of an irritating substance on the
brain.</p>

<p>We shall conclude, that in the accidental mixture of
air with the blood of the venous system, it is the brain
which dies the first, and that the death of the heart is the
consequence of the death of the brain. I shall explain
in another place, in what way this phenomenon is occasioned.</p>

of water into the mass of blood continues, whatever precaution may
be taken, its effects soon show themselves. We have often, in our
experiments, introduced a great quantity of water into the veins of an
animal, and though much of it passed off by pulmonary transpiration,
the arterial blood soon became very aqueous. Now, we have always
observed, that in this case, the animals were struck with a kind of

<p><a name="Footnote_63_63" id="Footnote_63_63"></a><a href="#FNanchor_63_63"><span class="label">[63]</span></a> A very considerable quantity of air can be forced into the veins of
an animal, without causing its death, provided it be not pushed in
suddenly. In all these cases, it is understood, that the quantity that
can be thus introduced is in proportion to the size of the animal. I
have before me at this moment the details of an experiment that I made
on a horse at Alfort with M. Dupui, and in which, before the animal
died, I was able, in thirty seven minutes, to inject quickly into the
veins forty syringes full of air, and three syringes full into the carotid
artery. (The capacity of the syringe was seventeen centilitres.) The
animal died three minutes after the last injection. At the examination
of the body, we found air in the azygos vein and in the thoracic duct,
which contained much lymph, as well as the lymphatic vessels of the
internal surface of the lungs. The heart was enormously distended
with air mixed with a small quantity of blood.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_64_64" id="Footnote_64_64"></a><a href="#FNanchor_64_64"><span class="label">[64]</span></a> This is not correct, and death takes place, on the contrary, by the
cessation of the motions of the heart. The right ventricle is filled with
air; and this air, dilated by heat, so distends it, that it can no longer
contract.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_65_65" id="Footnote_65_65"></a><a href="#FNanchor_65_65"><span class="label">[65]</span></a> The disorders which are produced in this case do not at all resemble
those which follow the entrance of air into the veins. If we push
towards the brain, by the carotid artery, a small quantity of air, we
see almost immediately signs of a strong cerebral congestion, spasmodic
stiffness of the muscles, loss of sensibility, and of the action of the
senses, and all the phenomena of a real apoplexy. Respiration and
the circulation go on some time without any apparent alteration, but
finally these two functions become embarrassed and the animal sinks.
Every thing leads to the belief, that the alteration in the circulation of
the brain depends here on the presence of rarefied air in the ultimate
arterial ramifications.
</p>
<p>
When apoplexy is thus produced by the injection of air, if it be still
forced into the artery, it breaks open violently a passage for itself, it
tears the small vessels, and spreads in the parenchyma of the brain,
which it makes emphysematous and crepitating under the finger.
There finally returns a portion of it by the veins, which goes to the right
cavities of the heart and which contributes to arrest the circulation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_66_66" id="Footnote_66_66"></a><a href="#FNanchor_66_66"><span class="label">[66]</span></a> In the two examinations related by Morgagni, it appears that after
a sudden death, there was found in the vessels of the brain an aeriform
fluid, to the presence of which, for the want of another material cause,
was attributed the death of the individual; but there is no proof that
this fluid might not be developed there after death. We shall now
relate a more decided case of death occasioned by the presence of air
in the blood vessels; but here there is no ground for doubt, because
we know the circumstances of the introduction.
</p>
<p>
A locksmith, twenty three years of age, had had for five years a
large tumour on the right shoulder and clavicle. His acute sufferings
induced him to enter the hospital to have it removed.
</p>
<p>
It was necessary in the operation to remove the middle portion of the
clavicle. Thus far the success was complete; but little blood was lost,
the pulse was good and the breathing easy, when the patient suddenly
cried out, <em>My blood is leaving my body! I am dead!</em> And at the same
moment he became stiff, lost his consciousness, and was covered with a
cold sweat. A singular and rather loud noise was heard in the interior of
his chest. The surgeon thought that he had opened the pleura by removing
a portion of the clavicle, and thus given access to the air and to the
blood to the right side of the thorax. The fingers of an assistant were
immediately thrust into the bottom of the wound, with the view of
stopping the supposed opening in the pleura, and the surgeon endeavoured
to introduce into the thorax the extremity of a sound of gum
elastic. When he thought that he had succeeded, he drew with his
mouth the air which he supposed to be effused in the pleura. He wished
then to proceed to the dressing; and, in order to do this, he substituted,
for the fingers of the pupil which were at the bottom of the wound, a
sponge covered with wax; but the moment the sponge took the place
of the fingers, the same noise that was at first heard and which had
ceased in an instant, was renewed with more force than before.
</p>
<p>
The syncope and cold sweat still continued. Water thrown into his
face, made him give some signs of life; but he died a quarter of an
hour after the appearance of the accident I have just described, and
forty five minutes after the commencement of the operation.
</p>
<p>
The body was examined the next morning. They expected to find
the right pleura open, much blood and air effused into its cavity and
the lungs on that side collapsed. Nothing of the kind was found. The
pleura was whole and there was no effusion in it. The lungs were
as usual; but an opening of half an inch in extent was discovered in
the external jugular vein, at the place where this vein opens into the
subclavian. The cavities of the heart were large but contained no
blood. Bubbles of air were observed in the vessels of the brain; the
other vessels were not examined.
</p>
<p>
This fact was related to me the same day, by a student who was
present. It was impossible for me not to refer the death in this instance
to the entrance of air into the vessels. The opening in the vein, the
noise that was heard, the suddenness of the death, the absence of blood
in the cavities of the heart, the presence of air in the vessels of the
brain, all sufficiently indicated it. I suspected that the entrance of
air had been favoured by the state of tension of the parietes of the
vein, or by their morbid alteration, which did not allow them to flatten
by atmospheric pressure. I thought that this phenomenon might be
produced at will on animals by placing them in the same physical
circumstances. I introduced then into the jugular vein of a dog, a
sound of gum elastic, and I directed it towards the heart. It was
hardly there before I heard the air enter the vein, and the animal fell
down in syncope, with the peculiar noise which manifests the presence
of air in the heart. I immediately closed the sound to prevent the
entrance of more air, and the animal gradually recovered, because the
quantity of air introduced had not been in sufficient quantity to produce
its death. I then opened the sound, and immediately the air
rushed in towards the heart, and its entrance was followed by the same
consequences; but, whether from not closing the sound soon enough,
or from the entrance of a greater quantity of air, the animal died unexpectedly
to me. In opening it, I found all the signs of death from the
sudden entrance of air. The right ventricle was distended with air
mixed with a little blood.
</p>
<p>
Sometimes, without any apparent alteration in the texture of the
veins, its parietes do not flatten under atmospheric pressure; a simple
puncture then is sufficient, as in bleeding, to admit the air into the
vessels. Lieutaud relates two cases in which it appears that this took
place, and several veterinary surgeons have assured me that they have
heard, after bleeding in the jugular vein, a noise which indicates the
entrance of air. Usually the quantity introduced is too inconsiderable
to produce any evident effects. There has been communicated to me,
however, a case observed by Mr. Bouley, the younger a veterinary
surgeon in Paris, in which the entrance of air was followed by effects
similar to those which we have related.
</p>
<p>
Mery had long since observed, that, in opening the abdomen of a dog,
and puncturing the vena cava above the origin of the emulgents, as the
vein become emptied of blood, it filled with air, which went to the
right ventricle. Haller also observed that air entered into the veins of
frogs and other cold-blooded animals in consequence of a wound of
some large vessel. He has shown that it was from this source that was
derived that which Redi, Caldesi, and Morgagni saw circulating in the
vessels of these animals, since it is not observed, when the necessary
precautions are taken to prevent its introduction.
</p>
<p>
Nysten has made a great number of experiments upon the injection
of elastic fluids into the veins, and the results which he has obtained
accord perfectly with those which we have observed. He is not satisfied
with injecting atmospheric air, he has introduced in the same way
a great number of other gases. He has remarked, that among the gases
not deleterious he can introduce, without causing death, a much greater
quantity if these gases are easily dissolved in the blood.
</p>
<p>
We cannot follow him in the detail of these experiments; we shall
only relate a result relative to the colouring of the blood in the lungs.
He has observed, that by injecting air into the vein, so slow as not to
produce the death of the animal, the colouring of the arterial blood is
rendered imperfect. He is satisfied, he says, that it is not owing to the
embarrassment of the lungs. The injection of oxygen does not alter
this colouring. The injection of azote completely prevents it; that of
the oxide of carbon does not produce any change in it. I give these
results from his work; I have not had occasion to verify them myself.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_67_67" id="Footnote_67_67"></a><a href="#FNanchor_67_67"><span class="label">[67]</span></a> When air is introduced into the vena portæ, there is not only no
ill effect at the moment of injection, but there usually follows no
apparent effect on the animal. It is not the same when air is injected
into the veins of the general system, with so much care as not to produce
instantaneous death by the dilatation of the heart. The effects do
not then appear till a long time after the injection; but they are wholly
different from the primary effects which we have described.
</p>
<p>
These consecutive symptoms from the entrance of air into the veins
are, as Nysten has remarked, the result of an obstruction of the lungs
produced by the accumulation of air in the last divisions of the pulmonary
artery. The embarrassment in respiration often appears at the end
of half a day, it becomes greater and greater, the bronchiæ are filled
with a viscid fluid; and the animal usually dies on the third or fourth
day. On examination of the body, no air is found in the heart or the
vessels; but the lungs, instead of being pink-coloured, are greyish,
tinged with brown, and loaded with frothy blood and mucus.
</p>
<p>
Boerhaave thought, that death which follows the injection of air into
the veins was always owing, as it is in this case, to the presence of the
air, which offers, in the small vessels, a mechanical obstacle to the
passage of the venous blood.</p></div></div>

<br />
<span class="fs50">OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE DEATH OF THE HEART OVER
THAT OF THE LUNGS.</span></h3>


<p>The lungs are the seat of two very different sorts of
phenomena. The first, which are entirely mechanical,
are relative to the rise and fall of the ribs and diaphragm,
to the dilatation and contraction of the air vessels, and to
the entry and exit of the air, which is the effect of these
movements. The second, which are purely chemical,
may be referred to the different alterations, which the
air and blood experience.</p>

<p>These two sorts of phenomena have a mutual dependence
on each other. Without the mechanical, the chemical
changes could not be made; without the chemical
changes, the blood would cease to become an excitant to
the brain, in consequence of which that organ would no
longer operate upon the diaphragm or intercostal muscles;
the muscles themselves would then become inactive, and
the motions of the thorax be annihilated. These phenomena,
however, are put an end to in a different manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
by the death of the heart, accordingly as it happens on
one or the other side.</p>


<h4>I. <em>In what manner are the actions of the lungs interrupted,
when the black-blooded heart ceases to act?</em></h4>

<p>The heart has certainly no influence over the mechanical
functions of the lungs, but it contributes essentially
to produce the chemical changes which are made there,
by sending thither the fluid which is destined to undergo
a change. When its functions then are interrupted as
may happen from wounds or be occasioned by ligature,
the chemical changes which should be made in the blood,
are suddenly suppressed; though the air continue to
enter into the lungs, from the dilatation and contraction
of the chest.</p>

<p>Meanwhile there arrives nothing at the red-blooded
heart, or<a name="FNanchor_68_68" id="FNanchor_68_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> so little as to be insufficient for the production
of the cerebral movements. The functions of the brain
are consequently suspended, and of course the movements
of the diaphragm and ribs.</p>


<h4>II. <em>In what manner are the actions of the lungs interrupted,
when those of the red-blooded heart are
suspended?</em></h4>

<p>Whenever from wound, ligature, or aneurism, the
functions of the red-blooded heart or aorta cease, the functions
of the lungs are terminated in the following order:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>1st. There is no further impulse made upon the brain.
2dly, No further movement of that organ.<a name="FNanchor_69_69" id="FNanchor_69_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> 3dly, No
further action exercised upon the muscles. 4thly, No further
contraction of the intercostals or diaphragm. 5thly,
The mechanical functions of the lungs cease. 6thly,
Their chemical functions cease.</p>

<p>In the former case, the chemical changes could not be
made for want of blood. Here they cannot be made for
want of air. Such is the difference in the death of the
lungs, in consequence of that of the heart, according
as the latter is affected. But as the circulation is very
rapid, there cannot be but a very short interval between
the interruption of the chemical and the mechanical functions
of the lungs.</p>

<br />
<span class="fs50">OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE DEATH OF THE HEART OVER
THAT OF ALL THE ORGANS.</span></h3>


<p>I shall divide this chapter, as the preceding one, into
two sections. In the first I shall examine, how the death
of the red-blooded heart, in the second how the death of
the black-blooded heart, is the cause of the death of all
the parts of the body.</p>


<h4>I. <em>On the death of the red-blooded heart, and how that
of the organs is occasioned by it.</em></h4>

<p>All the functions belong either to the animal, or to the
organic life. Hence the difference of their classes. Now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
the death of those of the first class, in consequence of
lesions of the red-blooded auricle and ventricle, is caused
in two ways, and first, because the brain in such case is
rendered inert from want of impulse, and can neither
have sensations, nor exercise an influence over the locomotive
and vocal organs.</p>

<p>Accordingly, all this order of functions is stopped, as
when the encephalic mass has experienced a violent concussion.
It is in this way that a wound of the heart, or
the bursting of an aneurism, annihilate all our relations
with external objects.</p>

<p>So strict a connexion between the movement of the
heart, and the functions of the animal life, is not observable
in those animals in which the brain, in order to act,
does not require the habitual stroke of the blood. Tear
away the heart of a reptile, or tie its large vessels, and
it will continue for a long time to move and have sensations.</p>

<p>Besides, supposing even that the action of the brain
were not to be suspended from lesions of the red-blooded
heart, the animal life would not, on that account, be the
less put an end to; because to the exercise of the functions
of this life, is attached as a necessary cause, the
excitement of its organs by the afflux of blood into them:
now this excitement, both here and every where else,
depends upon two causes.&mdash;1st, On the movement impressed,
and 2dly, On the nature of the blood. At present
I shall only examine the first mode of influence; the
latter will come under our consideration, when we speak
of the lungs.</p>

<p>Habitual motion is necessary to all the parts of the
body alike, is a condition essential to the functions of the
muscles, the glands, the vessels, and the membranes, &amp;c.
But this movement, which is partly derived from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
heart, is very different from that which is communicated
by the blood to the brain.</p>

<p>The latter organ receives an impulse by which the
whole of its mass is visibly raised, an impulse, in the
intermission of which the whole of its mass subsides.
On the contrary, the interior movement, by which its
particles are affected, is scarcely marked at all: and this
depends upon the smallness and the delicacy of the vessels
by which its substance is penetrated.</p>

<p>The contrary of this appearance is observed in the
movement occasioned in the other organs by the influx
of the blood into them: we see them neither rise nor
subside; there is nothing like a general impulse made
upon them, because, as I have said, such impulse is lost
from the little resistance of the surrounding parts. On
the contrary, they are penetrated by vessels of considerable
magnitude, which create an intestine motion, oscillations,
and impulses adapted to the actions of the tubes,
lamellæ, or fibres, of which they are composed. This
difference of movement may be easily conceived, by comparing
the manner in which the brain on the one hand,
and on the other the liver, the spleen, the muscles, or
the kidneys receive their blood; indeed it is requisite
that the brain should be distinguished from the other
organs, in the manner of receiving its impulses, because
it is enclosed in a case of bone, and consequently abstracted
from the thousand other causes of agitation, to which
the other parts of the body are exposed.</p>

<p>For we may remark, that all the other organs have
about them a number of agents, which are destined to
supply the place of that general impulse, which is wanting
to them on the part of the heart. In the breast, the
intercostals and diaphragm are continually rising and
falling; the lungs and the heart are successively the seat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
of a dilatation and contraction. In the abdomen, there
is an uninterrupted agitation produced, by the influence
of respiration upon its muscular parietes; an incessantly
variable state of the stomach, intestines and bladder.
Lastly, from the various contractions of the muscles, the
limbs have a still more evident cause of movement.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it is probable that every one of the
organs, as well as the brain, has a general though obscure
movement impressed upon it, from the pulsation of the
arteries; and hence, perhaps, we have the reason, why
the greater number of the viscera, receive the impulse
of the red blood upon their concave surfaces, as may be
seen in the kidneys, the liver, the spleen, and the intestines.
By such disposition, the impulse of the heart is
less divided.<a name="FNanchor_70_70" id="FNanchor_70_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a></p>

<p>From what has now been said, we may add another
reason to that which we have before given, for establishing
in what way the functions of the animal life are
interrupted from cessation of action in the red-blooded
heart. We may now also begin to explain the same
phenomenon in the organic life. The reason of such
interruption in both the lives is the same. It is as follows:</p>

<p>1st. In the case of death affecting the red-blooded
heart; the intestine movement, which proceeds from the
manner in which the arteries are distributed within the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
substance of all the organs, both of the one and the other
life, is suspended; hence there exists no farther cause of
excitement for the organs: they must consequently die.&mdash;2dly.
The causes of the more extensive and general
movements of the organs are abstracted; for almost all
these causes depend upon the brain. We respire and
move, only while the brain is alive: but as the brain
must be in a state of collapsus, as soon as it ceases to
receive the impulse of its blood, its influence must be
evidently annihilated.</p>

<p>Hence it follows, that the heart exercises over the
different organs two modes of influence; the one direct
and immediate, the other indirect, and made through the
medium of the brain, so that the death of the organs in
consequence of the death of the heart, is immediate or
mediate.</p>

<p>We have sometimes examples of partial death, analogous
to this sort of general death. Thus, when the
circulation is impeded in a limb, and the red blood no
longer distributed to its parts, such parts become at first
insensible and paralytic, then gangrenous. The operation
of aneurism furnishes us with too many instances of
this phenomenon, which by ligature, may be produced
also in the living animal. Undoubtedly the principal
cause of death in these cases, is the want of that stimulus
which it is the business of the particles of the red blood
to create, in contradistinction to those of the black blood,
but the absence of the intestine movement in question, is
by no means a less real cause of such death.</p>

<p>As for the interruption of the nutritive process, it
cannot be admitted as a cause of the symptoms which
succeed after the obliteration of a large artery. The
slow, the gradual, and insensible way, in which this
function is performed, does not accord with the sudden<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
and instantaneous production of those symptoms, especially
as they affect the animal life; for this is annihilated
in the limb at the very instant when the blood ceases to
flow into it, just in the same way as it is, when by the
section of its nerves, the influence of the brain is abstracted.<a name="FNanchor_71_71" id="FNanchor_71_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a></p>

<p>Besides the preceding causes, which, when the heart
is dead, suspend in general the whole of the animal and
organic functions; there is another cause of death which
especially affects the greater number of the latter, such
as the processes of nutrition, exhalation, secretion, and
therefore digestion, which is only performed by means of
the secreted fluid. This cause of death to which I refer,
consists in the necessary stop which is put to these different
functions, in consequence of their no longer receiving
the materials upon which they are exercised. Nevertheless,
such term arrives by degrees only, because they
receive the materials on which they act, from the capillary,
and not from the general circulation. Now the
capillary circulation, is only subject to the influence of
the insensible contractile powers of the parts in which it
is performed; and is exercised independently of the heart,
as may be seen in the greater number of reptiles, where
the heart may be taken away, and the blood be notwithstanding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
observed to oscillate for a long time afterwards
in the minuter vessels.<a name="FNanchor_72_72" id="FNanchor_72_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a> It is manifest, then, that whatever
quantity of blood is left in the capillary system at
the period of the death of the heart, will for some time
afterwards be sufficient to keep up the functions in question,
and that such functions in consequence will only
gradually cease.</p>

<p>The following is a general view of the manner in which
the annihilation of all the functions succeeds to the interruption
of those of the heart.</p>

<p>The animal life is terminated&mdash;1st, Because the organs
of which it is composed, are no longer excited without,
by the movement of the neighbouring parts, nor within,
by the blood.&mdash;2dly, Because the brain, from want of
excitement, can no longer be a cause of excitement.</p>

<p>The organic life is terminated&mdash;1st, Because, as in the
animal life, there is a want of external and internal excitement
for its different viscera.&mdash;2dly, Because there is a
want of the materials on which its functions are particularly
exercised.</p>

<p>There are a number of other considerations, however,
besides those which we have mentioned, which prove the
reality of the excitement of the organs, from the movement
communicated to them by the blood, as well as the
reality of the cause, which we have asserted to be that of
their death, when such excitement ceases.</p>

<p>For, 1st.&mdash;The organs which are penetrated only by
the serum of the blood, such as the hair, the nails, the
tendons, and cartilages, enjoy a less degree of vitality,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span>
and a less energetic action, than those in which the blood
is made to circulate, either immediately by the heart, or
by the insensible contractile powers of the parts themselves.</p>

<p>2dly.&mdash;When the white organs are inflamed, they
receive an augmentation of life, a superabundance of sensibility,
which frequently put them on a level in many
respects with those organs, which in their natural state
are endowed with the highest degrees of life and sensibility.</p>

<p>3dly.&mdash;Those organs which habitually receive the influx
of the red blood, when inflamed, exhibit, in every instance,
a local exaltation of the phenomena of life. In the two
preceding instances, it is true, indeed, that the change of
vital powers, precedes in point of time, the change which
is made in the circulation; the organic sensibility of the
part, has been augmented before the blood is carried
thither in greater quantity; but afterwards it is the afflux
of such increased quantity of blood, which keeps up the
unnatural action which has been established. A determined
quantity of blood in the ordinary state of the part,
is necessary to the maintenance of that state; but when
the part receives a double or triple increase of energy,
its excitant also must be doubled or tripled; for in the
exercise of the vital powers, there are always three things
to be remarked; the power inherent in the organ; the
excitant which is foreign to it; and the excitement which
is the product of the two.</p>

<p>4thly.&mdash;It is doubtless, for this reason, that the organs
to which the blood is habitually carried by the arteries,
enjoy a degree of life, proportionate to the quantity of
fluid by which they are injected. Such phenomenon
may be observed in the glans penis, in the corpora cavernosa,
in the nipple, in the skin of the face, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
actions of the brain, whenever the blood is directed with
impetuosity towards them.</p>

<p>5thly.&mdash;The whole of the circulatory system, is thrown
into greater action from the exaltation of the whole of the
vital phenomena, just in the same way as the particular
circulation of any part is augmented, when the particular
phenomena of the life of that part are increased. The
use of spirituous liquors, and spices to a certain quantity,
is followed for a time by a general increase of energy in
the powers of the system. The access of inflammatory
fever will double and triple the intensity of life.</p>

<p>In these considerations I have only regarded the movement
which is communicated to the organs by the blood.
In another place I shall call the attention of the reader
to that species of excitement, which is produced by the
nature of the blood, by the contact of its component
particles when in a state of oxydation or otherwise, with
the different parts of the body. The reflections which I
have offered, will be amply sufficient to convince us how
much the blood, independently of the materials which
it conveys with it, by its simple influx, is necessary to
the activity of the organs, and consequently how much the
cessation of the functions of the heart, must influence the
death of the organs.</p>

application of a principle which is by no means proved: viz. that the
different organs, in order to exercise their functions, require to be
agitated by a partial or general motion. We have already made it
appear, that as it respects the brain, this jarring of the whole mass, to
which Bichat attributes so much importance, appears to be a circumstance
purely accidental from the entrance of the arterial blood. The
same may be said of the oscillatory motion produced in the other organs
by the pulsation of the ultimate arterial ramifications.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_71_71" id="Footnote_71_71"></a><a href="#FNanchor_71_71"><span class="label">[71]</span></a> When the passage of the arterial blood to a muscle is stopped, a
more or less complete numbness soon takes place; and this effect is
too sudden to be attributed to the want of nutrition; and as certainly
it is not owing to the want of agitation by the pulsations of the small
arteries; for if, the artery is left free, and a ligature is applied upon
the vein, the pulsations are increased rather than diminished and yet the
numbness appears as quick as before.
</p>
<p>
When the muscle has been a long time without receiving blood,
gangrene seizes upon it; and this can then be attributed, in great
measure, to the want of nutrition. The diminution of the temperature,
which necessarily takes place in an organ in which the blood is not
renewed, must also contribute to this disorganization.</p></div>

<br />
<span class="fs50">OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE DEATH OF THE HEART AS TO
THE PRODUCTION OF GENERAL DEATH.</span></h3>


<p>Whenever the heart ceases to act, general death is
produced in the following manner:&mdash;1st. For want of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
excitement the cerebral actions are annihilated, and consequently
an end is immediately put to all sensation,
locomotion, and utterance. Besides, for want of excitement
on the part of the blood, the organs of these functions
would cease to act, even supposing that the brain
were to remain unaffected, and exert upon them its accustomed
influence. Thus the whole of the animal life is
suddenly suspended, and at the instant of the death of the
heart, the individual is dead to what surrounds him.</p>

<p>The interruption of the organic life, which has commenced
by the death of the heart, is produced at the same
time by that of the lungs. The brain being dead, the
mechanical functions of the lungs must cease: the chemical
functions of the lungs must cease also, for want of
the materials on which they are exerted: the latter are
directly interrupted, the former through the medium of
the brain.</p>

<p>After this the progress of death is gradual. The secretions,
the exhalations, the nutritive actions are put an end
to. The latter are first arrested in those organs which
receive the more immediate impulse of the blood, because
in these, such impulse is necessary to the performance of
the functions. The paler organs are less dependent on
the influence of the heart, and consequently must be less
affected by the cessation of its action.<a name="FNanchor_73_73" id="FNanchor_73_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a></p>

<p>In the successive termination of the latter phenomena
of the internal life, the vital powers continue to subsist
for some time after the loss of the functions: thus, the
organic sensibility, and the sensible and insensible contractilities<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
survive the phenomena of digestion, secretion,
and nutrition.<a name="FNanchor_74_74" id="FNanchor_74_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a></p>

<p>The vital powers continue to subsist in the internal
life, even when the corresponding powers of the animal
life, have suddenly become extinct: the reason is plain:
the power of perceiving and moving organically does
not suppose the existence of a common centre; for the
animal perceptions and motions, the action of the brain
is requisite.</p>

<p>The phenomena of death are concatenated in the above
order in all aneurismal ruptures, in all wounds of the
heart or larger vessels, in all cases of polypi formed in
the cardiac cavities,<a name="FNanchor_75_75" id="FNanchor_75_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> of ligature artificially applied, of
compression exercised on the parietes of the heart by
humours, abscesses, &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>It is in this manner also that we die from sudden affections
of the mind. The news of a very joyful, or a very
melancholy event, the sight of a fearful object, of a
detested enemy, of a successful rival, are all of them
causes capable of producing death. Now in all these
instances, it is the heart, which is the first to die, the
heart, whose death successively produces that of all the
other organs, the heart, on which the passion is exerted.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>And hence we are led to some considerations on syncope,
an affection exemplifying in a less degree the same
phenomena, which in a greater one, is offered us in cases
of sudden death.</p>

<p>The causes of syncope are referred by Cullen to two
general heads: Of these there is one set which according
to him affect the brain, another set which affect the heart.
Among the first, he places the more violent impulses on
the mind, and various evacuations, but it is easy to prove,
that the brain is only secondarily affected in syncope produced
by passion, and that it is the heart, whose functions
in all these cases are the first to be interrupted. The
following considerations, if I am not mistaken, will leave
but little doubt on this head.</p>

<p>1st.&mdash;I have proved, in speaking of the passions, that
they never affect the brain in the first place; that the
action of this organ, in consequence of their development,
is only secondary, and that every thing relating to
our moral affections has its seat exclusively in the organic
life.</p>

<p>2dly.&mdash;The phenomena of syncope when produced by
lively emotion, are similar in every respect to those of
syncope, the effect of polypi or dropsy of the pericardium,
but in the latter, the affection of the heart is the primary
one, and should in consequence be the same in the former
sort of syncope.</p>

<p>3dly.&mdash;At the moment when syncope takes place, we
feel the attack at the heart, and not in the brain.</p>

<p>4thly.&mdash;In consequence of lively passions, which may
have occasioned syncope, we find that the heart and not
the brain becomes diseased, nothing is more common than
organic affections of the former from sorrow, &amp;c. The
different sorts of madness, which are produced by the
same cause, for the most part have their principal seat in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
some of the viscera of the epigastrium, and in such case,
the irregularity of the cerebral action is the sympathetic
effect of the profound affection of the internal organ.<a name="FNanchor_76_76" id="FNanchor_76_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a></p>

<p>5thly.&mdash;I shall prove hereafter, that the cerebral system
does not exert any direct influence over that of the circulation;
that there is no reciprocity between the two, and
that the changes of the first are not followed by similar
changes in the second, however much the changes of the
second may modify the first. Destroy all nervous communication
between the brain and the heart, and the
circulation will go on as usual; but if the vascular communications
be intercepted, the cerebral action vanishes
at once.</p>

<p>6thly.&mdash;Palpitations and other irregular movements of
the heart are often the effect of the same causes, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
in some individuals are the occasion of syncope. In such
cases, it is easy to discover the seat of the affection, and
such smaller effects of the passions on the heart, are
very well calculated to throw light upon the nature of the
greater.<a name="FNanchor_77_77" id="FNanchor_77_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p>From these many considerations, we may conclude that
the primitive seat of the attack in syncope, is the heart,
which does not cease to act, because the action of the
brain has been interrupted, but because it is the nature of
some of the passions in such way to affect it, the brain
at the same time, suffering a temporary death, because it
no longer receives the fluid, which is necessary to its
excitement. The nature of syncope is well enough illustrated,
by the vulgar expression of being sick at heart.</p>

<p>It is of no importance to our present purpose, whether
syncope depend on polypi, on aneurism, or be the result
of some violent emotion. The successive affection of the
organs is always the same. They die for the moment in
the same way, as they really perish when the heart is
wounded, or a ligature put upon the aorta. In the same
manner also are those sorts of syncope produced, which
succeed after any great evacuation of blood, pus or water.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
The heart is affected from sympathy, the brain for want
of its excitant.<a name="FNanchor_78_78" id="FNanchor_78_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Those cases of syncope which are occasioned by peculiar
odours, by antipathies, &amp;c. appear also to be attended
with the same progression of symptoms, though their
character be much less easily understood. There is a great
difference between syncope, asphyxia, and apoplexy, in
the first it is by the heart, in the second by the lungs, in
the third by the brain that begins the general death of the
body.</p>

<p>Death, as it happens in consequence of disease, in general
exemplifies a concatenation of these different symptoms.
The circulation, respiration, or cerebral action
cease, the other functions are afterwards interrupted of
necessity, but in these sorts of death, it rarely happens
that the heart is the first to die. This however is sometimes
the case. After long continued suffering, great
suppuration, and sometimes, in dropsy, certain fevers,
and gangrenes, one fit of syncope comes on after another,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
at last a longer one succeeds, and the patient dies, but
whatever be the part affected, whatever the diseased
viscus or organ, whenever the phenomena of death commence
by the heart, they succeed each other as we have
described them to do in sudden death, from lesion of that
organ. In other cases, the heart is the last to act, is the
ultimum moriens.</p>

<p>In general, in morbid affections, we much more commonly
observe the ingress of death to be made by the
lungs, than either by the heart, or the brain.</p>

<p>Whenever disease is terminated by syncope, the lungs
are found to be almost empty, and if not affected by any
organic disease, are collapsed, occupy a part only of the
cavity of the thorax, and are of their natural colour.</p>

<p>The reason of this anatomical fact is simple. The
circulation which has been suddenly interrupted, has not
had time to fill the vessels of the lungs, as happens when
death begins, by affecting the lungs or the brain. The
truth of this fact I can vouch for, having frequently
ascertained it by dissection, and in general, as often as
death commences by the heart, or the larger vessels, such
vacuity of the lungs may be considered as universal.</p>

<p>I have remarked it in the bodies of persons who have
died from great hemorrhage from wounds or aneurismal
rupture and violent passion, as well as in those who have
suffered by the guillotine. The same phenomenon may
be seen, by inspecting the lungs of any animal, which is
killed in our butcheries.</p>

<p>In killing the animal slowly by the lungs, that organ
might be filled with blood. Its taste would then be different
from that which it naturally possesses, and resemble
that of the spleen. Our cooks know well how to
take advantage of that state of infiltration in which the
latter viscus is generally found.</p>

fatty polypi, which were formerly considered as causes of death. It is
probable that those yellowish concretions of albuminous matter which
are found between the pillars of the auricle, and which seem to be fixed
there, were mistaken for polypi. There is sometimes found in individuals
formerly affected with the venereal disease, vegetations near the
valves; but these productions are commonly too trifling to oppose the
expulsion of the blood contained in the cavity.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_76_76" id="Footnote_76_76"></a><a href="#FNanchor_76_76"><span class="label">[76]</span></a> The singular idea of placing the seat of madness in the viscera of
the abdomen, arose at a period when a certain number of mystical
ideas formed the basis of all physiology. The four sorts of humours
performed in the human body (<em>microcosm</em>) a part as important as the
four elements did in the whole universe (<em>macrocosm</em>). The bile, the
blood, the pituitary and atrabiliary fluids determined, by their predominance
the different temperaments, and produced the different diseases.
The atrabiliary humour was, as is well known, thought to be the cause
of melancholy and mania; now this humour was said to be secreted
by the supra-renal capsules, and the position of these organs no doubt
gave the name of hypochondria, which is given to a certain degree of
mental alienation.
</p>
<p>
After a great number of ages, the mysterious properties of numbers
are almost entirely out of favour. We still speak of the four temperaments,
but attach no importance to the four ages of man or to the four
parts of the day. We recognize in the human body more than four
kinds of fluids, but among them all we do not find the atrabiliary fluid.
The cause of madness then cannot be attributed to this humour, and
yet we dare not drive this disease from the seat it has so long held. In
order to find reasons for keeping it there, they seek in the viscera for
disorders which are not often found there even in the most striking
cases, and which most often still exist without the least alteration in the
intellectual functions.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_77_77" id="Footnote_77_77"></a><a href="#FNanchor_77_77"><span class="label">[77]</span></a> We should be often exposed to commit great mistakes, if we always
judged by this rule. The sensation is a very uncertain means of determining
the organ that is primarily affected; this can be proved by
numerous examples, we shall cite one only which relates to the brain.
Nausea and vomiting are often, as is well known, among the first
symptoms of cerebral affections; should we from this believe that the
seat of the disease is in the stomach? Undoubtedly not: now, in
syncope produced by a strong affection of the mind, there is no reason
to suppose that the heart is affected before the brain, since the intellectual
phenomena have necessarily preceded the sensation of joy or
of sorrow which has produced the syncope. But to say that the brain
was primarily affected, is not saying that its action ceased before that of
the heart; and every thing, on the contrary, leads to the belief that the
loss of the senses is a consequence of the suspension of the circulation.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_78_78" id="Footnote_78_78"></a><a href="#FNanchor_78_78"><span class="label">[78]</span></a> The syncope is produced in this case, from the sudden change in
the circulation of the brain. But this change varies according to the
seat of the effusion. If it be in the peritoneal cavity, the pressure that
it makes interrupts the circulation in all the organs contained in the
abdomen; the descending aorta is found compressed, and the blood,
forced back towards the superior parts, accumulates in the sinuses and
vessels of the brain. If the fluid be evacuated by puncture, the
equilibrium is re-established in the different parts of the vascular system,
the blood enters vessels which were before closed to it, it abandons
in part those of the brain, and it is this sudden change in the circulation
of the organ which produces syncope. If, on the contrary, the
effusion be formed between the two layers of the arachnoides, and we
can, as in spina bifida, evacuate the fluid by puncture, the vessels of the
brain are immediately relieved of the pressure to which they had been
subjected, and the blood, which before was forced back, towards the
inferior parts, is driven forcibly into them; the change is, as must be
perceived, the reverse of the preceding; but the result is the same, and
syncope is produced in this case as in the other.</p></div></div>

<h3><a name="P2_CHAPTER_VI" id="P2_CHAPTER_VI"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER VI.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="fs50">OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE DEATH OF THE LUNGS OVER
THAT OF THE HEART.</span></h3>


<p>We have already said, that the functions of the lungs
are of two kinds, mechanical and chemical. Now the
activity of this organ ceases sometimes by the former,
and sometimes by the latter of these functions.</p>

<p>Any wound, which exposes the lungs on both sides,
for a considerable extent, occasions their sudden collapse;
any division of the spinal marrow, which suddenly paralyses
the intercostals, and the diaphragm; any very
strong compression exerted at the same time upon the
whole of the thorax, and the parietes of the abdomen,
any sudden injection of a large quantity of fluid into this
cavity, are all of them causes which begin the death of
the lungs, by putting an end to their mechanical functions.
Those which influence in the first place their chemical
functions, are the different sorts of asphyxia, strangulation,
submersion, and a vacuum, in whatever manner
produced.</p>


<h4>I. <em>In what manner is the death of the heart occasioned
by the interruption of the mechanical functions of
the lungs?</em></h4>

<p>The interruption of the functions of the heart, can
only succeed in two ways to that of the mechanical functions
of the lungs: 1st. Directly, because a mechanical
impediment is put to the circulation of the blood, by a
state of collapse in the lungs. 2dly. Indirectly, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span>
in such state the lungs no longer receive the materials,
upon which their chemical functions are exerted, and
therefore cannot transmit them to the heart.</p>

<p>Physiologists have all of them admitted the first mode
of interruption, in the Pulmonary circulation. Reflected
on themselves, the vessels of the lungs have not appeared
to them, to be capable of transmitting the blood, on
account of the numerous angles which they make. This
idea they have borrowed from the phenomena of hydraulics,
and it is their reason for the death which ensues, in
consequence of a too long continued expiration.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding all which, it has been proved by
Goodwyn, that in such case there remains a sufficient
quantity of air in the air vessels, for dilating them enough
to allow of the mechanical passage of the blood; he
proves in consequence, that an unnatural permanence of
the state, in which the lungs are placed from the act of
expiration, does not affect the blood in the way, which is
commonly believed. This is one step towards the truth,
but we shall approach it much more nearly, and even
attain it, should we be able to prove, not only that there
remains a sufficiency of air in the lungs to permit the
transmission of the blood, but that the very folds produced
in the vessels by a state of collapse in the organ
are not a real impediment to its course. The following
observations and experiments will assuredly determine
this fact.</p>

<p>1st.&mdash;I have already proved, that a state of fulness or
emptiness in the stomach, and in all the hollow organs in
general, produces no apparent change in the state of their
circulation; and that the blood in consequence, will
traverse the vessels, when bent or doubled upon themselves,
as easily, as when they are distended in every
direction. For what reason should a different effect be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
produced in the lungs, by the same disposition of the
parts?</p>

<p>2dly.&mdash;There are different vessels in the œconomy
which we may alternately bend or extend at pleasure:
such are those of the mesentery, when exposed by an
incision into the abdomen of the animal. Now in this
experiment, which has been already made to prove the
influence of the tortuous direction of the arteries upon the
mechanism of their pulsation, if one of the mesenteries
be opened, and then either bent or extended, in either
case the blood will be thrown out with the same degree
of violence, and in equal times will be emitted in equal
quantities. I have always obtained the same result in this
experiment which I have many times repeated. From
analogy we might expect the same from the vessels of
the lungs;<a name="FNanchor_79_79" id="FNanchor_79_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> and from the following experiment it may be
proved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span></p>

<p>3dly.&mdash;Take a dog, cut the trachea, and adapt the tube
of an injecting syringe to it, then make a vacuum in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
lungs, and cut the carotid artery. It is evident, that
according to the common belief, the circulation should
be immediately suspended, in this experiment, since the
pulmonary vessels from their ordinary state of distension,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
must have passed to the greatest possible degree of collapse,
in consequence of the total abstraction of air;
notwithstanding which the blood will be violently thrown
out from the divided arteries for a certain time, and must
consequently traverse the lungs: it will afterwards cease
by degrees, but this, from causes which I shall explain
hereafter.</p>

<p>4thly.&mdash;The same effect may be produced by opening,
on both sides, the breast of a living animal, because the
warm and rarified air of the lungs, will be more than
balanced by the pressure of the colder air without;<a name="FNanchor_80_80" id="FNanchor_80_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> now,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
neither in this case does the circulation experience any
sudden change. For the sake of greater exactness, the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
little air remaining in the cells of the organ may be
voided by a syringe.</p>

<p>Along with these observations let us place the facility
with which the pulmonary circulation continues to be
made, when collections of water, pus, or blood, are lying
within the pleura, or pericardium. In these cases the
air vessels are often prodigiously contracted, and consequently
the vessels of their parietes doubled and bent.<a name="FNanchor_81_81" id="FNanchor_81_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a>
If this state be taken into consideration, we shall have
sufficient data for concluding that the tortuous disposition
of the vessels, can never be an obstacle to the passage of
the blood; and therefore, that the interruption of the
mechanical functions of the lungs, can never directly put
a stop to the action of the heart, though it may do so
indirectly, in impeding the exercise of the chemical
functions of the lungs.</p>

<p>If then we can determine why the heart remains
inactive, when the latter phenomena are annihilated, we
shall have resolved a double question.</p>

<p>Many authors have asserted that the death, which
ensues after a too long continued inspiration, is owing to
the mechanical distension of the pulmonary vessels by
the rarified air, a distension impeding the circulation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
But this reason also is as false a one, as that which we
have already disproved. Inflate the lungs as powerfully
as may be, then tie the trachea and open the carotids, and
the blood will flow as impetuously as when the respiration
was perfectly free.<a name="FNanchor_82_82" id="FNanchor_82_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a></p>


<h4>II. <em>Why does the heart cease to act, when the chemical
functions of the lungs are interrupted?</em></h4>

<p>According to Goodwyn, the reason why the contractions
of the heart are stopped, when the chemical functions
of the lungs have ceased to be performed, consists
in the want of that excitement which the red blood only
can produce upon the red-blooded ventricle. This ventricle,
says he, has not a sufficient stimulus in the black
blood, and death is occasioned because it no longer is
capable of transmitting any thing to the different organs.
In this case death must happen, as it would from ligature
of the aorta&mdash;precisely in the same way as when its
source is exclusively in the heart. The other parts die
only for want of blood, just as when in a machine, the
principal spring being taken away, the others cease to
act, because they are not put into action.</p>

<p>On the contrary, I am persuaded that there is a general
affection of all the parts, whenever the chemical functions
of the lungs are suspended; I am persuaded that the
black blood continues to be pushed on for some time by
the aorta, and that its influx into the organs is the occasion
of their death; that the organs die in fact, not
because they do not receive blood, but because they do
not receive red blood; in a word, that they are penetrated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span>
by the material cause of their death; so much so, that
we may asphyxiate any isolated part at will, by injecting
it with venous blood while all the others shall continue
to receive the red blood of the heart. At present I shall
inquire into the phenomena of the contact of the black
blood with the parietes of the ventricle, and refer the
reader to the following chapters, for its effects upon the
other parts.</p>

<p>The movements of the heart may be stopped and made
to cease altogether from the influence of the venous blood
in two ways.&mdash;1st. As Goodwyn has said, because the
left ventricle is not excited by it upon its internal surface.&mdash;2dly.
Because such fluid, when carried into the
substance of the heart by the coronary vessels, must act
upon the muscular fibre of the heart in the same way as
it does upon the other muscles. Now, for my part, I am
assured that the black as well as the red blood, will excite
into contraction the internal surface of the aortic ventricle.
The following observations and experiments will confirm
my assertion.</p>

<p>1st. If asphyxia were to be followed by the consequences
which Goodwyn has supposed, it should influence
the heart in the first place; the annihilation of the functions
of the brain, as in syncope, should be only secondary;
nevertheless, asphyxiate an animal, by stopping up
the trachea, by placing him in a vacuum, by opening the
chest, or plunging him into carbonic acid gas, and it will
in every instance be observed, that his animal life is the
first to be interrupted, and that the creature externally is
dead; but that within the heart continues for some time
afterwards to act, and the pulse to be felt.</p>

<p>In this way the symptoms of asphyxia are not the
symptoms of syncope. In the latter the cardiac and
cerebral actions are suspended at the same instant, in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span>
former the heart survives, as in cases of strong concussion
of the brain for many seconds. It follows, that in
asphyxia, the different organs do not cease to act, because
the heart has ceased to supply them with blood, but
because it no longer supplies them with that sort of blood
by which they can be stimulated.</p>

<p>2dly. If the trachea of an animal be stopped, and an
artery opened, the colour of the blood which it emits,
will gradually be changed, and at last become as black as
that of venous blood. Now, notwithstanding this phenomenon,
which is as apparent as it can be, the fluid for
some time afterwards is thrown out full as strongly as it
would be, were it red. I have seen a quantity of black
blood discharged in this way, more than sufficient to kill
the creature from hæmorrhage; were it not already dead,
in consequence of its asphyxiated state.</p>

<p>3dly. In the last-mentioned experiment, it may, indeed,
be alleged, that some remains of air in the air cells,
might, as long as the black blood continued to flow, have
communicated to it a principle of excitement; but to put
it out of all doubt, that the venous blood does really pass
into the aortic ventricle, unaltered in its passage from the
corresponding cavity, the air may be entirely pumped out
of the lungs with a syringe, by exposing the trachea, in
the first place, and then adapting the instrument to the
transverse section of the tube; after this, let the carotid
be opened; now as soon as the red blood contained in
this artery is exhausted, the black blood will succeed to
it, and that, without undergoing a variety of gradations
in colour; in this case also for a time, the jet will be
very powerful, and only be gradually weakened; but if
the black blood were not an excitant to the heart, its
interruption should be immediate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span></p>

<p>4thly. The following is another proof of the same
nature. Expose the breast on one side by sawing exactly
through the ribs before and behind: when this is done,
the lungs on that side will collapse. Proceed to open
one of the pulmonary veins; fill a syringe warmed to the
temperature of the human body with venous blood, then
push it into the red-blooded ventricle. Now, according
to the common opinion upon the subject of asphyxia, such
fluid should at least diminish in a sensible way, the
movement of that cavity, notwithstanding which, in four
successive experiments, I could not observe any such
diminution. On the contrary, in one of them, on pushing
the piston, the strokes of the heart were augmented
in number.</p>

<p>5thly. If the black blood be not an excitant to the
heart, it can only want such power, because it contains
more carbon and hydrogen, than the red blood;<a name="FNanchor_83_83" id="FNanchor_83_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> but if
the heart of an animal, which has been killed expressly
for the experiment, by lesion of the brain or of the lungs,
has ceased to beat, it may, notwithstanding, be made to
contract as long as it preserves its irritability, by throwing
into the aortic ventricle either hydrogen gas, or
carbonic acid gas. It follows, that neither hydrogen gas
nor carbon can act as sedatives to the heart.</p>

<p>The experiments which I made and published last year,
on the emphysemata, produced in different animals with
these gases, have established the same truth with respect
to the muscles, since they do not cease to move in consequence
of such experiments, and after death, preserve
their irritability as they usually do.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span></p>
<p>Lastly. I have often succeeded in re-establishing the
contractions of the heart, which have been annihilated in
different sorts of violent death, by the injection of black
blood into the red-blooded cavities, with a syringe adapted
to one of the pulmonary veins.</p>

<p>Thus it is proved, that the red-blooded heart does
actually push the black blood into all parts of the body;
and in this way is the colour given to the different surfaces,
of which, in one of the following chapters, I shall
offer a sketch.</p>

<p>Neither does the simple presence of the black blood
act in a more sedative way upon the internal surfaces of
the arteries.<a name="FNanchor_84_84" id="FNanchor_84_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> If, in fact, while the tube adapted to the
trachea is shut, the blood be made to flow from an artery of
the foot, it will be thrown out for some time, with the same
force which it would have been, were the pipe to be open.
The action, then, which it exercises in its passage from
the heart, upon the parietes of the arteries, does not
diminish the energy of these parietes. When this energy
decreases, it is at least in part from a different cause.</p>

<p>From the above experiments we may conclude, that
the black blood arriving in mass at the red-blooded ventricle,
and correspondent arterial system is able, from its
sole contact with them, to occasion the action of these
cavities; we may be equally certain, that were not the
functions of these parts suppressed from other causes, the
circulation would continue to be made in a very sensible
manner, at least, if not with force.</p>

<p>Of what nature, then, are the causes which interrupt
the circulation in the heart and arteries when they are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
supplied with venous blood? for when this has been
flowing for some time, the jet of it is gradually weakened,
and ceases at last entirely; yet if the cock of the pipe be
opened, it will be restored with vigour.</p>

<p>I am persuaded that the black blood acts upon the heart
as it does on all the other parts, as we shall see that it
affects the brain&mdash;that it affects the voluntary muscles,
the membranes, and the system in general; the tissue of
which it penetrates and operates within it as a debilitant
upon each individual fibre. I am fully of opinion, that
the circulation would be almost as quickly interrupted as
in the preceding cases, were it even possible to supply
the coronary arteries of the heart with red blood, while
the black blood is transmitted to the various parts of the
body by the aortic auricle and ventricle.</p>

<p>The black blood operates by its contact with the fleshy
fibres, at the extremity of the arterial system and not by
its contact with the internal surface of the heart. Thus
it is only by little and little, and when each fibre has been
as it were injected, that the powers of such fibres diminish
and cease. On the contrary supposition, their cessation
and diminution should be almost sudden.</p>

<p>It may be demanded in what manner the black blood
acts at the extremities of the arteries, upon the fibres of
the different organs. Is it upon the fibres themselves, or
upon the nerves which are distributed to them? I am
rather inclined to suppose the latter to be the fact, and to
consider asphyxia as an effect produced in general by the
black blood upon the nerves, which every where accompany
the arteries of a certain diameter: for as we shall
presently see, the debility which in such case the heart
experiences, is only a particular symptom of a disease
in which the organs in general are the seat of a like
debility.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span></p>

<p>It might be demanded also in what way, that is to say,
by what manner of influence, the black blood acts upon
the nerves or fibres. Is it from the principles which it
actually contains, or from the absence of those which are
proper to the red blood? Is oxygen the principle of
irritability&mdash;are hydrogen and carbon the reverse?</p>

<p>These questions have been sufficiently disputed.&mdash;Let
us stop when we arrive at the limits of rigorous observation.
Now, I think, that we shall establish an assertion
the most strictly conformable with such principle, in saying
generally and without determining the manner, that
the heart ceases to act, when the chemical functions of the
lungs are interrupted, because the black blood with which
its fleshy fibres are penetrated, is not of a nature to keep
up their action.</p>

<p>From this manner of regarding the phenomena of
asphyxia with relation to the heart, it is evident that
both the ventricles should be equally affected by it, because
their parietes must be equally injected with venous
blood. Nevertheless, it is constantly observable, that
the movement of the red-blooded heart is the first to
stop; that the black-blooded heart in every case the ultimum
moriens; but this phenomenon does not suppose a
more real, a more decided debility in the one, than in the
other heart; for as Haller observes, the fact is common
to every kind of death in the red-blooded animal, and not
the case particularly in asphyxia.&mdash;Besides, were the red-blooded
heart the first to be absolutely affected, as the
theory of Goodwyn supposes, the following would be the
appearances on opening the asphyxiated subject.&mdash;1st. A
distension of the corresponding auricle and ventricle, by
the black blood which they would not be able to expel
into the aorta.&mdash;2dly. An equal fulness of the pulmonary
veins and lungs.&mdash;3dly. A consequent fulness and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span>
swelling of the pulmonary artery and the black-blooded
cavities. In a word, the congestion of the blood should
be the greatest in that of its reservoirs, whose action is
the first to cease.</p>

<p>But this is contrary to observation&mdash;for 1st. In the
asphyxiated subject, the red-blooded cavities and pulmonary
veins, contain but a very small quantity of blood in
proportion to that which distends the opposite heart.
2dly. The place where the blood has stopped, is found
to be principally in the lungs, in the lungs must we begin
to follow its accumulation into the venous system. 3dly.
The arteries are as full of blood as their correspondent
ventricles, and consequently it cannot be in the ventricle
more than elsewhere, that death has been begun.</p>

<p>But what is the reason why the black-blooded heart is
the last to beat? because, says Haller, it is the longest
excited; because it contains a greater quantity of blood;
because the blood is sent into it from the largest veins
of the system, and regurgitates from the lungs. The
famous experiment is well known by which in emptying
the black-blooded cavities, and tying the aorta so as to
retain the blood within the red-blooded cavities, the contractions
of the latter are prolonged so much beyond the
contractions of the former. But in this experiment it is
manifestly the black blood which accumulates in the aortic
auricle and ventricle, because the breast must be preliminarily
opened, and therefore the lungs collapse.</p>

<p>Should a more direct proof be required, immediately
before the experiment, let the trachea be closed with a
syringe, and the air of the lungs be voided; the experiment
will just as well succeed; besides, the operator to
be sure of the colour of the blood in the aortic cavities,
has nothing more to do than to open them, as soon as he
has finished his experiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>We shall conclude that the black blood is almost as
powerful a stimulus as the red blood to the inner surface
of those cavities, which usually contain the latter only:
the reason why they are the first to be arrested in their
action, is, because they do not receive so large a quantity
of blood as the others.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding what I have said, I do not entirely
reject the idea of the red-blooded ventricle being not
excitable by the black blood. It may indeed be less
excitable by this sort of blood, than by the other; but I
believe that the preceding considerations will reduce this
difference of excitement to a mere trifle.</p>

<p>The following, however, is an experiment where such
difference would appear to be very manifest. If a stop
cock be adapted to the trachea, and an artery opened, the
blood will blacken, and continue for some time to be
thrown out with its ordinary force, but at last the jet will
gradually grow weaker. If, after this, the air be admitted,
the blood will almost immediately become red and
its jet be visibly augmented. In this case the sudden
augmentation appears at first to depend upon the simple
contact of the red fluid with the sides of the aortic ventricle,
since it has not had the time to penetrate the tissue
of the heart; but let things be a little attentively examined,
and it will soon be seen that this impetuosity of
impulse, depends on the movements of inspiration and
expiration, to which the animal is obliged, on the admission
of air into the lungs. The heart excited at its
exterior, and perhaps a little compressed by these movements,
is the occasion of such phenomenon, and expels
the blood with a force which is far beyond that which
results from its habitual contractions.</p>

<p>What I have here advanced is proved, by the manifest
diminution of the jet, as soon as once the lungs have taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
on their accustomed degree of action. Besides, the influence
of a series of full expirations may be manifested
without dividing the trachea. Open the carotid and precipitate
the respiration of the animal by tormenting it
(for pain will constantly have this effect) and the jet of
blood will be visibly increased. The same augmentation
may be artificially produced, by suddenly compressing
the parietes of the thorax. These experiments succeed
best on animals already weakened by the loss of a certain
quantity of blood.</p>

<p>In the ordinary state of health however, a series of
strong expirations will not be found to quicken the pulse.
Of this I cannot assign the reason.</p>

<p>From what we have now said, it follows, that the
experiment, in which, on the opening of the cock of the
syringe, the blood is thrown out with augmented force,
is not so conclusive as might at first be imagined. I confess
that it embarrassed me much for many days, I hold
then my former conclusions to be good.</p>

<p>In the red and cold-blooded animals, the action of the
lungs has not so immediate a connexion with that of the
heart, as it has in the red and warm blooded animals.</p>

<p>I tied the lungs of two frogs at their basis, having
previously exposed them, by incisions made laterally into
the breast, the circulation however continued as usual for
a considerable time. After this experiment, I have seen
on opening the breast, the movements of the heart precipitated,
a circumstance depending no doubt upon its
contact with the air.</p>

<p>I shall finish this chapter by the examination of an
important question, and inquire into the reason, why when
the chemical functions of the lungs are stopped, the pulmonary
arteries, the black-blooded cavities of the heart,
and in a word all the venous system, are found so much<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span>
more full of blood, than the aortic system. In such case
the circulation appears at first to be interrupted in the
lungs, and then in the other parts, according to their
proximity to the lungs.</p>

<p>This phenomenon must have been observed by all
who have opened the asphyxiated subject. It has been
explained by Haller and others, from the tortuosity of
the vessels; but this opinion I have sufficiently refuted.<a name="FNanchor_85_85" id="FNanchor_85_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_85" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>But before I proceed to assign a more real cause, I
shall observe, that the lungs, (when the blood is first
arrested, because it finds in them the first obstacle to its
progress,) are found in a singularly various state, according
to the kind of death of which the individual has died.
In sudden, in instantaneous death, neither the lungs, nor
the black-blooded heart are very much distended.</p>

<p>I have observed this fact, 1st. In the bodies of two
persons who had hanged themselves and were brought
into my amphitheatre. 2dly. On two subjects who had
fallen into the fire, and were instantly suffocated. 3dly.
On dogs which I have suddenly drowned. 4thly. Upon
guinea-pigs, which I have killed in a vacuum, or in different
gases, or otherwise.</p>

<p>On the contrary, arrest the phenomena of respiration
in a gradual manner; drown the animal by plunging him
in water, and taking him out alternately, asphyxiate him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span>
by placing him in a vessel of gas imperfectly closed, continue
as long as possible such state of pain and anguish,
and the lungs will be found extremely full of blood.</p>

<p>Between the extreme fulness, and the almost complete
emptiness of the pulmonary vessels, there is a variety of
degrees; now by the manner in which we kill the animal,
we can determine any one of these degrees at will: It is
in this way that we must explain that state of fulness in
the lungs of such subjects, as are usually brought into
our amphitheatres: in the greater number of cases, the
attacks of death are slow and gradual.</p>

<p>But whatever be the state of the lungs in the asphyxiated
subject, the venous system is full of black blood,
especially about the heart. In this respect, there is
always a very wide difference between the veins and the
arteries, and accordingly the blood must find in the lungs
the principal obstacle to its circulation: such obstacle, as
we have said, does not proceed from the tortuosity, and
state of collapse in the pulmonary vessels; its causes are
relative, first to the blood, secondly, to the lungs, thirdly
to the heart.</p>

<p>The principal cause depending on the blood, consists
in the great quantity of this fluid, which passes from the
arteries into the veins. In fact we shall soon see, that
the black blood when it circulates in the arteries, is not
capable of furnishing the materials of secretion, exhalation,
or nutrition, or if it be so, that it is not a stimulus
to the organs which are the agents of these functions.<a name="FNanchor_86_86" id="FNanchor_86_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[230]</a></span></p>

<p>It follows as a necessary consequence, that the portion
of fluid which is usually taken up from the arterial system
by these different functions, flows on into the venous
system, together with the portion which should naturally
pass thither; hence there must be contained a greater
quantity than usual in the veins; and therefore a greater
difficulty be experienced in its passage through the lungs.
Practitioners in opening the bodies of asphyxiated persons,
have always remarked the abundance of blood
which is met with there. The fact has been particularly
remarked by Portal, and I have always found it in my
experiments.</p>

<p>The causes of obstacle to the passage of the blood proceeding
from the lungs, are first the non-excitement of
this organ by arterial blood. In asphyxia, the bronchial
arteries are penetrated by the black blood as well as the
rest. Hence its obscure and dusky colour in this case.
This colour and its successive shades, may be easily
remarked in the collapsed lung, when the chest is opened;
but in asphyxia, such blackness is principally owing
to the colour of the blood, contained in the pulmonary
veins.</p>

<p>The black blood when circulating in the bronchial
vessels, produces upon the lungs the same effect which it
does in the heart, by penetrating the coronary arteries;
it weakens the different parts&mdash;impedes their action, and
the capillary secretions which should be made there, from
the tonic powers of the organ.</p>

<p>The second cause of obstacle to the circulation, when
the chemical functions of the lungs are interrupted, is
the non-excitement of the organ by vital air. The first
effect of such air upon the mucous surfaces of the air-cells,
is to stimulate them, and so to keep them up in a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
sort of perpetual erethism.<a name="FNanchor_87_87" id="FNanchor_87_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> In the same way are the
powers of the stomach brought into action by the presence
of aliment there, and those of every reservoir of the
body, by the influx of their accustomed fluids. Again,
such excitement of the mucous surfaces by foreign substances
keeps up their tone. The privation of such
excitement, therefore, must put a stop to their capillary
secretions, which depend upon their tonic powers.</p>

<p>The different aeriform fluids which take the place of the
atmospheric air in the different sorts of asphyxia, appear
to act very differently upon the tonic powers, or the insensible
organic contractility of the lungs. Some of these put
a sudden stop to the circulation, others not. Compare
the asphyxiæ produced by nitrous or sulphurated hydrogen
gas, with those which may be occasioned by pure
hydrogen, or carbonic acid gas, and the difference will
instantly be seen. This difference indeed, as well as
the various other phenomena observable in the various
asphyxiæ, depends on causes which we have not mentioned,
but the affection of the air-cells, is evidently one
of them.</p>

<p>Lastly, the third cause of stagnation of the blood in
the venous vascular system, is that debility, which takes
place in the ventricle and auricle of this system, when
penetrated with venous blood: on the influx of the blood
from the cava, they are consequently distended, and this
is the case also with the cava itself, for the very same
reason. The causes which are now assigned, are sufficient
to shew why the black-blooded system, is gorged with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
fluids in asphyxiæ.<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> The following considerations will
shew why the red-blooded system contains a lesser quantity
of fluid.</p>

<p>1st.&mdash;The obstacle commences in the lungs; therefore
the aortic heart must receive a less quantity than usual:
hence, as we have seen, proceeds the quicker cessation of
the contractions of this ventricle.</p>

<p>2dly.&mdash;The natural strength of the arteries, though
enfeebled by the influx of blood into their parietes, is
much superior to that of the veins, which besides are
subject to the same cause of debility.<a name="FNanchor_89_89" id="FNanchor_89_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> Accordingly these
vessels and the aortic ventricle, are capable of surmounting
the resistance of the capillary vessels of the body in
general, much more easily than the veins and the venous
ventricle, are of vanquishing the capillaries of the lungs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span></p>

<p>3dly.&mdash;In the general capillary system, there is only
one cause of want of action, viz. the presence of black
blood in it; to this in the lungs there is added another
cause, the want of that habitual excitement which this
organ receives on the part of the atmospheric air: accordingly
in the lungs, there is a greater resistance offered to
the influx of the blood, and with respect to the heart, a
less capability of surmounting such resistance. In the
other parts, the contrary of all this is observed, a less
resistance to the influx of the blood from the arteries into
the veins on the one hand, and on the other a greater
capability of overcoming such resistance.</p>

<p>4thly.&mdash;In the general capillary system, which is continued
on from that of the arteries, if the circulation be
embarrassed at first, in any organ in particular, it may
still continue to go on in the other organs, more or less,
in which case the blood regurgitates by these others into
the veins. On the contrary, as all the capillary system,
which is the continuation of the general venous system,
is concentrated in the lungs, the venous circulation must
be suppressed, whenever this organ loses its powers.</p>

<p>The preceding considerations, if I am not mistaken,
explain why the vascular systems are so unequally full
of blood after death, a circumstance, which is common to
almost every disease, as well as the asphyxiæ.</p>

<p>In the latter sort of death however, although the general
capillary system presents a less degree of resistance
than is made by the capillary system of the lungs, nevertheless
such resistance arising from the influx of the black
blood into the organs in general is very manifest, and
produces two remarkable phenomena.</p>

<p>The first is a greater quantity than usual of black blood
in the arteries, and therefore a greater difficulty of injecting
these vessels. Such blood is seldom coagulated.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span>
Indeed in all cases the venous blood is much less coagulable
than arterial blood. This fact is proved, 1st, By
the experiments of modern Chemists. 2dly, By the
comparison of the blood of varices with that of aneurisms.
3dly, By the inspection of that which usually stagnates
after death in the veins of the neighbourhood of the heart.</p>

<p>The second circumstance, to which I have referred, is
the general livid colour of the greater number of the surfaces,
with the fulness of divers parts, such as the face, the
tongue and lips. These two phenomena indicate a stagnation
of the blood at the extremities of the arteries, in the
same way as they denote the same effect in the pulmonary
vessels; here there is a much more evident repletion,
because as I have said, the capillary system is there concentrated
within narrow limits.</p>

<p>The reflux of the blood of the veins towards the
extremities is the reason assigned by authors for the livid
appearance of asphyxiated persons. There is little reality
in this cause: in fact, this reflux, which is very sensible
in the trunks of the veins, diminishes continually towards
their ramifications, where it is impeded and rendered
impossible by the valves, besides which, the following
experiment is an evident proof, that we must attribute the
lividity in question, to the impulse of the black blood
from the aortic ventricle.</p>

<p>1st.&mdash;Adapt a syringe with its stop-cock to the divided
trachea. 2dly, Open the abdomen so as to distinguish
the intestines and epiploon. 3dly, Shut the cock. At the
end of two or three minutes, the red tint which animates
the peritoneum, and which is borrowed by this membrane
from the vessels, which creep underneath it, will be
changed into a dull brown colour. This colour may be
made to disappear and re-appear at will, by opening or
shutting the syringe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Here we cannot, as if the experiment were made upon
other parts, suspect that a reflux is propagated from the
right ventricle towards the venous extremities, since
the mesenteric veins, together with the other branches of
the vena portæ, form a system apart, independent of the
great black-blooded system, and having no communication
with the cavities of the heart which correspond with
this system.</p>

<p>But I shall touch again upon this subject. The above
experiment is amply sufficient to prove, that the lividity
of the surfaces of the body is owing to arterial impulse.</p>

<p>At present we are in a condition to explain how the
lungs are more or less gorged with blood, more or less
livid, and how the livid spots upon the different parts
of the body are more or less marked accordingly as
the asphyxia has been more or less prolonged: for it is
evident, that if before death, the black blood have gone
round the two systems ten or twelve times, it will inject
the extremities much more than if it had made such circulation
only two or three times; at each revolution, a
greater or less quantity will be left in the extremities,
for want of action in the capillary vessels.</p>

<p>In finishing this chapter I shall take occasion to observe,
that the spleen is the only organ of the economy susceptible
like the lungs of assuming a very great variety of
volume. Scarcely is it ever found in the same state. It
has been falsely supposed that there is a relation between
the plenitude or vacuity of the stomach, and the inequalities
of the spleen; but this is not the case, as I have said
elsewhere. Such inequalities during the life of the body
do not exist, and supervene only at the instant of death.</p>

<p>It appears to me, that they depend especially upon the
state of the liver, the capillary vessels of which, are the
continuations of all the branches of the vena portæ as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
the capillaries of the lungs are those of the great venous
system. Thus, when the hepatic capillaries from any
cause whatever are enfeebled, the spleen must swell and
be filled with the blood, which cannot traverse the liver.<a name="FNanchor_90_90" id="FNanchor_90_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a>
In such case, if I may so express myself, there is an
isolated asphyxia of the abdominal vascular apparatus.
The liver being to the spleen, what the lungs are to the
black-blooded cavities in common asphyxia. The resistance
is in the former, the stagnation in the latter. But
this matter may be better understood hereafter. Experiments
upon animals killed in different ways, would
throw much light upon it, and these I purpose undertaking.
By these means we may rigorously establish the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span>
analogy existing between the stagnation of the blood in
the different branches of the vena portæ, and that which
is observed in the general venous system, in consequence
of various kinds of death. With respect to the spleen and
its system of veins, in ordinary asphyxia, I have never
remarked in it any peculiarity.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_79_79" id="Footnote_79_79"></a><a href="#FNanchor_79_79"><span class="label">[79]</span></a> It is not because the vessels of the lungs have become tortuous that
the blood flows through them with difficulty, but because they are compressed.
It was needless for Goodwyn to seek for reasons to prove,
that the flattening of the lungs does not offer a mechanical obstacle to
the course of the blood. If he had observed with attention the phenomena
of respiration, he would have seen that this contraction, if it
does not completely interrupt the circulation of the blood in the lungs,
at least modifies it in a very remarkable manner. When the lungs contract,
not only the bronchial cells are flattened, but the pulmonary
vessels are compressed, and tend to expel the blood contained in their
cavity. This fluid flows back then on one part towards the right ventricle
by the pulmonary artery, and on the other it accumulates in the
pulmonary veins before entering the left auricle. Hence we see that
the jet by the carotid artery must increase rather than lessen in the last
moments. But if the compression continues, as the capacity of the ramifications
of the pulmonary artery is diminished as well as that of the
veins of the same name, the quantity of blood which passes through the
lungs is less, and the jet by the carotid necessarily decreases. The
experiment related by Bichat is then entirely opposed to the opinion
which he advances.
</p>
<p>
It is not only by influencing the course of the blood in the system of
pulmonary vessels that the alternate motion of the thorax modifies the
circulation. If we lay bare the jugular vein of a dog, we perceive that
the blood does not move in its cavity from the sole influence of the
right auricle, but in an evident manner from the influence of the motions
of respiration also.
</p>
<p>
At each time that the thorax is dilated in inspiration, the vein is
quickly emptied, flattened and its parietes are sometimes brought
exactly against each other; it swells on the contrary and fills with blood
when the thorax contracts. A similar phenomenon takes place in the
venæ cavæ. In order to render it evident it is sufficient to introduce
by the jugular vein into the venæ cavæ a sound of gum elastic; we then
see that the blood flows through the extremity of the sound only during
the time of expiration. A similar effect is observed if we introduce a
sound into the crural vein and direct it towards the abdomen.
</p>
<p>
Haller and Lorry have paid much attention to this phenomenon, and
have proposed an explanation of it which seems very satisfactory at
first view, though it is really imperfect. When the thorax is dilated,
say they, it draws the blood from the venæ cavæ, and, by degrees, that
of the veins which are near it. The mechanism of this inspiration is
very similar to that by which the air is drawn into the trachea. When
the thorax contracts, on the contrary, the blood is crowded back in
the venæ cavæ by the pressure which is made on all the pectoral organs,
vessels, heart and lungs, by the expiratory powers, and by degrees
arrives at the veins which terminate in them. Hence the alternation
of vacuity and fulness which the jugular veins exhibit.
</p>
<p>
If we open an artery, and examine with attention the jet of blood,
we see that it increases in expiration, and this is especially evident
when the animal expires strongly or makes an effort; but as we cannot
always produce these efforts at will, or a great inspiration, we can in
some measure imitate the phenomenon and produce the contraction of
the lungs by compressing with the hands the sides of the thorax; we
see then the jet of arterial blood increase or diminish, in proportion to
the pressure that is made. If respiration produces this effect on the
course of the blood in the arteries, it is natural to think that it can
influence the course of the venous blood, not only by means of the veins,
as Haller and Lorry thought, but also by means of the arteries. For the
purpose of satisfying myself, I made the following experiment, I tied
the jugular vein of a dog; the vessel became empty below the ligature,
and swelled much above, as uniformly happens. I punctured slightly
with a lancet the distended portion, so as to make a very small opening.
I obtained in this way a jet of blood, which the ordinary motions of
respiration did not modify evidently, but which trebled or quadrupled
in size if the animal made any considerable effort.
</p>
<p>
It might be objected, that the effect of respiration was not transmitted
by the arteries to the open vein, but by the veins which were
free, and which would have transmitted the blood of the venæ cavæ,
towards the tied vein, by means of anastomoses. It is easy to remove this
difficulty; in fact, in the dog the internal jugular vein is, as it were, but
the appearance of a vein, and the circulation of the head and neck is
performed almost entirely by the external jugular veins, which are very
large. By tying at the same time these two veins I was sure of preventing,
in a very great measure, the reflux which has just been spoken of;
but so far from the double ligature diminishing the phenomenon before
stated, the jet becomes on the contrary more strictly in relation with
the motions of respiration, for it was evidently modified, even by common
respiration; which, as we have seen, does not happen in the case
of a single ligature. In order to render the thing more evident, I tried
it on the crural vein; this vein and all its branches being furnished with
valves, which oppose a reflux, if this phenomenon of the increase of
the jet appears during expiration, we might be sure that the impulse
came from the arteries. This is what I have observed in fact in many
experiments. The crural vein being tied and punctured below the
ligature, the jet which is formed increases evidently in powerful expirations,
in the efforts and the mechanical compressions of the parietes
of the thorax with the hands.
</p>
<p>
We see by this and the preceding experiments, that we cannot adopt
without modification the expression of Haller and Lorry relative to the
swelling of the veins. This swelling takes place, not only, as they
say, by the flowing back of the blood of the venæ cavæ into the
branches which open into them mediately or immediately, but also by
the entrance into the vein of a greater quantity of blood coming from
the arteries.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_80_80" id="Footnote_80_80"></a><a href="#FNanchor_80_80"><span class="label">[80]</span></a> As in dead bodies the air within and the air without are of the same
temperature, the lungs, when they are full of it, do not flatten when the
thoracic cavity is opened. There is usually then a space between the
parietes and the contained organs; this is not because we die in expiration;
for as the lungs empty themselves, the ribs and intercostal muscles
rest upon them; it is because the pulmonary air, in cooling occupies
less space, and the cells contracting gradually as the cooling takes place,
diminish the whole size of the organ. A vacuum is then made between
the pectoral and pulmonary portions of the pleura.
</p>
<p>
It is thus that, under some circumstances, the brain flattening and
lessening after death, whilst the cavity of the cranium remains the same,
a vacuum is formed between these two parts, which then exhibit an
arrangement different from that of the living organs. If the sacs without
an opening, as the peritoneum, tunica vaginalis, &amp;c. never resemble,
in this respect, the pleura and arachnoides; if their different surfaces are
always contiguous after death, it is because the abdominal parietes or
the skin of the scrotum, unable to resist the external air, flatten by
pressure, and are brought against the internal organs, as the diminution
of these tends to form a vacuum.
</p>
<p>
It is to this vacuum existing in the pleura of dead bodies, that must
be referred the following phenomenon, which is always observed when
the abdomen is opened and the diaphragm dissected. In fact, as long
as no opening is made in this muscle, it remains distended and concave,
notwithstanding the weight of pectoral viscera which rest upon it in
a perpendicular situation, because the external air, which presses the
concavity of it, forces it then into the vacuum in the thorax, which
never exists during life. But the instant the air is admitted by a cut of
the scalpel, this muscular partition flattens, because the equilibrium
is established. If all the air is drawn from the lungs by a syringe, the
diaphragmatic arch is still more evident.
</p>
<p>
There is then this difference between the opening of a dead body and
that of a living one, that in the first the lungs are already flattened, and
in the second they flatten at the instant of opening. The contraction
of the cells, from the condensation of the air by cooling, is an effect of
the contractility of texture or from want of extension, which as we
have said, continues in a degree with the organs after death.
</p>
<p>
Besides, if the lungs flattened in the dead body the instant the thorax
was opened, it would be owing to the pressure of the external air, a
pressure which would expel through the trachea what was contained
in these organs. Now if, to prevent the escape of air, you close hermetically
the canal by fixing a tube to it the stopper of which is tight,
and the thorax is afterwards opened, the lungs still flatten; the air had
already gone out of them. Make, on the contrary, the same experiment
on a living animal, you will always prevent the flattening of these
organs, by preventing the expulsion of the air.
</p>
<p>
In this point of view Goodwyn has gone on a wrong principle in
measuring in a dead body, the quantity of air remaining in the lungs
after each expiration. Besides, if you open bodies ever so little, you
will hardly find two in which there is the same arrangement in the
lungs. The infinitely various manner in which life terminates, by accumulating
more or less blood in these organs, by retaining more or less
air in them, &amp;c. gives them so variable a size, that no general data can
be established respecting them. On the other hand, can we hope to
be more successful on the living body? No; for who does not know
that digestion, exercise, rest, the passions, tranquillity of mind, sleep,
watchfulness, temperament, sex, &amp;c. make an infinite variety in the
forces of the lungs, the rapidity with which the blood circulates through
them, and the quantity of air that penetrates them? All the calculations
on the quantity of this fluid which enters or goes out according to
the inspiration or the expiration, appear to me to be physiological
errours, inasmuch as they assimilate the nature of vital forces with that
of physical forces. They are as useless to science as those which had
formerly for their object the muscular force, the velocity of the blood,
&amp;c. Besides, observe if their authors agree better among themselves
then they used to do on this much agitated point.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_81_81" id="Footnote_81_81"></a><a href="#FNanchor_81_81"><span class="label">[81]</span></a> It is inconceivable how Bichat could think of confirming his opinion
by the example of hydrothorax. Who does not know that when an
effusion takes place in the cavity of one of the pleuras, that that portion
of the lungs only which is above the level of the water serves the
purposes of respiration; that when the effusion has arrived to the summit
of the cavity, the lungs of that side, which can no longer dilate,
are of no use in respiration; and those of the other, being compelled
alone to make the necessary modifications in the blood, must be
traversed by the greatest part of this fluid? It is known, finally, that
in this case the patient cannot lie down an instant on the sound side,
because this position prevents the dilatation of the lungs of that side
which alone serve for respiration, and the danger of suffocation is
therefore imminent.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_82_82" id="Footnote_82_82"></a><a href="#FNanchor_82_82"><span class="label">[82]</span></a> The observation of Bichat is very just; and I have myself often
observed in cases of apoplexy, that the motions of the heart continue
many hours after the arteries contain only black blood.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_83_83" id="Footnote_83_83"></a><a href="#FNanchor_83_83"><span class="label">[83]</span></a> At the period Bichat wrote, it was impossible to know whether the
arterial or venous blood contained most hydrogen and carbon. At the
present day even, when the means of analysis are much more perfect
and animal chemistry farther advanced, we are hardly better informed.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_84_84" id="Footnote_84_84"></a><a href="#FNanchor_84_84"><span class="label">[84]</span></a> It seems that when Bichat wrote this work, he had not fixed in his
own mind what part the arteries take in the circulation; at least, in
this paragraph, he seems to give them a contractile power, which, in
his other works, he accords only, to their ultimate ramifications.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_85_85" id="Footnote_85_85"></a><a href="#FNanchor_85_85"><span class="label">[85]</span></a> It is certain, whatever Bichat may say concerning it, that numerous
angles in the course of a blood-vessel, by increasing the friction, must
retard the course of the fluid which runs through its cavity. We may
in fact believe that it is one of the causes, which, in the flattening of
the lungs, embarrass the circulation; this cause exerts its action principally
upon the last ramifications of the pulmonary artery which, by
their interlacing, form the bronchial cells; another more powerful cause,
which acts equally on the divisions of the vein and the artery is, as we
have said, the pressure made on the lungs by the flattening of the thorax,
and the elevation of the diaphragm.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_86_86" id="Footnote_86_86"></a><a href="#FNanchor_86_86"><span class="label">[86]</span></a> See the article on the influence of the lungs on all the parts. I am
compelled here to deduce consequences from principles which I shall
prove hereafter; such is in fact the connexion of questions which have
the circulation for their object, that the solution of one draws as a
necessary consequence that of all the others. It is a circle in which it
is always necessary to suppose something, leaving it to be proved afterwards.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_87_87" id="Footnote_87_87"></a><a href="#FNanchor_87_87"><span class="label">[87]</span></a> I cannot see what can have induced Bichat to admit this erethism
of the lungs, the use of which cannot be imagined. It is quite enough
to suppose in the organs the existence of those concealed properties,
when there is need of them to explain their functions.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_88_88" id="Footnote_88_88"></a><a href="#FNanchor_88_88"><span class="label">[88]</span></a> As the blood flows in the veins in a continuous motion, the distension
of these vessels does not take place in the direct motion of the
blood, but in its retrograde motion. Every time the right auricle contracts,
a portion of blood, instead of passing into the ventricle of the
same side, is forced back into the superior and inferior venæ cavæ, and
into the principal venous trunks which open into them. By this reflux
of the blood, these veins are dilated, and have a pulsation which is
easily seen in the jugular in very thin people. This pulsation has
received the name of the <em>venous pulse</em>. When it is very evident, it
may indicate an obstacle to the passage of the blood from the auricle
to the right ventricle.
</p>
<p>
Another reflux of the blood in the veins corresponds with the moment
of expiration, and is perceptible even longer. We shall soon have to
speak of it, in speaking of the <em>movements</em> of the brain.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_89_89" id="Footnote_89_89"></a><a href="#FNanchor_89_89"><span class="label">[89]</span></a> <em>The natural force of the arteries</em> is not dependent on life, and consequently
cannot be enfeebled by the entrance of black blood. This
force is nothing but elasticity, which indeed ceases to be in action as soon
as death takes place, but which does not cease to exist till the texture
itself is destroyed and disorganized. As this property is very conspicuous
in the arteries, it is sufficient to drive the blood from their cavity at
the instant of death, whilst it is too feeble in the veins to expel this
fluid entirely. Thus it is, that we find blood in the veins only, after
death.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_90_90" id="Footnote_90_90"></a><a href="#FNanchor_90_90"><span class="label">[90]</span></a> The state of the spleen in the dead body may become in some
measure an index of the state of the circulation during the last moments
of life. The swelling of it shows almost always the embarrassment of
the circulation; and not only in an insulated system, such as that of the
vena portæ, as Bichat considers it, but in the whole pulmonary system.
</p>
<p>
When any cause impedes the circulation in the capillaries of the
lungs, it necessarily produces a stagnation of the blood in the divisions
of the pulmonary artery, and by degrees the disturbance is felt even in
the two venæ cavæ, but especially in the inferior in which the blood
rises against its gravity. The blood accumulates in the principal
branches; the veins of the liver and kidneys swell more or less; as to
these organs themselves, the firmness of their texture hardly allows
them to be distended, so they do not increase sensibly in size, or if this
increase takes place, it is slow. It is not the same with the spleen; the
looseness of its texture will admit a great quantity of liquid, and its
size can thus be doubled or trebled in a very short time. It becomes
then a kind of reservoir, in which is accumulated the blood which
cannot pass through the lungs.
</p>
<p>
It may be objected to what we have just said, that oftentimes in
phthisis the greatest portion of the lungs has become incapable of
allowing the blood to pass, and that yet after death, the spleen is found
in a natural state. But it should be recollected, that phthisical patients
have, during the latter part of their lives, but very little blood, so that
each portion sent by the right ventricle always finds a sufficient channel
for it in the lungs.</p></div></div>

<br />
<span class="fs50">OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE DEATH OF THE LUNGS OVER
THAT OF THE BRAIN.</span></h3>


<p>We have just seen, that in asphyxia, the movements
of the heart are paralyzed, because its fleshy fibres are
penetrated with venous blood. This fact should indicate
the same to be the case with reference to the action of the
brain. It is indubitably proved by experiment.</p>

<p>Whatever be the manner in which the pulmonary
functions are interrupted, it is always the interruption of
the chemical changes, which troubles the functions of the
brain.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> What I have said upon this point with respect<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
to the heart, is exactly applicable to the cerebral mass: I
shall not repeat it. It remains to shew by experiment,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span>
and the observation of diseases, that when the chemical
functions of the lungs are put a stop to, it is the black
blood which interrupts the action of the brain and that of
the nervous system. In the first place let us examine our
experiments.</p>

<p>I first began by transfusing into the brain of an animal,
the arterial blood of another, that this essay might serve
as a point of comparison for others. Open one of the
carotids of a dog; tie the extremity towards the brain,
and fasten a tube to that which is next the heart; then
open the carotid of another dog, tie the extremity of the
vessel next the heart, and fix the other end of the tube
into that which is next the brain; then let the assistant,
who meanwhile should have had his fingers upon the
artery of the first dog underneath the tube, remove his
compression, and the carotid of the second dog will be
seen beating under the impulse of the blood injected from
the heart of the first. This operation fatigues but little
the animal which receives the blood, particularly if one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span>
of the veins be previously opened, to prevent too great a
fulness of the vessels. It will live very well afterwards.
This experiment has been often repeated, and always
with the same results.</p>

<p>After this experiment, I opened the carotid, and the
jugular vein of another dog, and after tying the extremity
of the carotid next the heart, received the blood of the
jugular into a warm syringe, and injected it into the
brain. The creature appeared immediately to be agitated,
breathed quickly, and seemed to be in a state of suffocation,
similar to that of asphyxia. Its animal life became
entirely extinct; the heart, however, continued to beat,
and the circulation to go on for half an hour afterwards;
at the end of which time the organic life was terminated
also.</p>

<p>This dog was of a middle size, and about six ounces of
blood were injected with a gentle impulse, for fear of that
being attributed to the shock, which ought to have been
the result of the nature and composition of the fluid. I
repeated this experiment upon three dogs the same day,
and afterwards at different times upon others; the result
was invariable, not only as to the asphyxia of the animal,
but even as to the concomitant appearances.</p>

<p>It might be thought that out of its vessels, and exposed
to the contact of the air, the blood might imbibe a pernicious
principle, or be deprived of that which is requisite
for the maintenance of life. It might be imagined, that
to this cause was owing the sudden death of the dog, on
the injection of the brain with venous blood. To shew
that this was not the case, I made a small opening in the
jugular of a dog, to which I adapted a moderately warm
syringe, and pumped the blood immediately from the
vein.&mdash;It was afterwards thrown into the carotid: the
symptoms were the same as the preceding, but less marked,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
and the death of the creature induced more slowly.&mdash;It
is probable, then, that the air when in contact with the
living blood without its vessels may alter it a little, but
the essential cause of death is still the same.</p>

<p>Hence it appears that the black blood either is not an
excitant capable of keeping up the cerebral action, or that
it acts in a deleterious manner, upon the brain. The
injection by the carotid of various other substances will
produce analogous effects.</p>

<p>I have killed animals in this way with ink, oil, wine,
and water coloured with indigo. The greater number of
the excrementitious fluids, such as urine, bile, the mucus
of catarrhs, occasion death also by their simple presence
on the brain. The serosity of the blood is fatal, but not
as quickly so. Now it is certainly upon the substance of
the brain, and not upon the internal surface of the arteries,
that these different substances exert their influence. I
have injected them all into the crural artery. In this
way they are none of them mortal, but occasion always
a torpor, amounting even to paralysis at times.<a name="FNanchor_92_92" id="FNanchor_92_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span></p>
<p>The black blood is doubtless fatal to the brain, the brain
becoming at once a tonic from its presence. In what way<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
does it act? I do not pretend to determine the manner;
for this were only to begin a series of conjectures.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span></p>

<p>By this time we are authorised to conclude, that in
asphyxiæ, the circulation which continues for some time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
after the interruption of the chemical functions of the
lungs, interrupts the cerebral functions, from its being
composed of black blood only. The fact is proved in
another manner, for the movements of the brain continue
to be made as usual.</p>

<p>If the cerebral mass be exposed, and the creature
asphyxiated, the animal life will be extinguished, but the
motion of the brain will be apparent still. Since then the
latter cause of life subsists, the cause of death must be in
the nature of the fluid, by which the organ is penetrated.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if any affection of the brain coincide with
asphyxia, the death which is occasioned by the latter,
will be quicker than is usually the case. Strike a dog a
violent blow upon the head, and then if he be deprived of
air, he will die on the instant. In asphyxiating another
animal already in a state of stupor, from compression of
the brain, I observed that the vital functions were interrupted
somewhat sooner, than when the brain is untouched
during that operation; but the consequences hitherto
deduced, may be supported by other experiments.</p>

<p>If in asphyxia the black blood suspend the action of the
cerebral mass, it is evident that the black blood taken
from the arteries of an animal dying of asphyxia, and
injected into the brain of another, will be the cause of
death.</p>

<p>The experiment will be found to succeed&mdash;cut the
trachea, of a dog, and tie it up hermetically; then in the
course of two or three minutes, open the carotid and
receive into a syringe the blood, which flows from the
vessels; inject it into the brain of another animal, and it
will die.</p>

<p>The following experiment is very similar, but offers a
somewhat different result. 1st. Adapt a tube with a stop-cock
to the trachea of a dog, and a tube of silver to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
carotid, next the head, after dividing this vessel, and tie
up the extremity towards the heart. 2dly. Fix the other
end of the tube to the divided carotid of another dog next
the heart, and tie the extremity of the vessel towards
the head. 3dly. Shut the cock of the tube in the trachea,
and the black blood of the one dog in a short time, will
be injected into the brain of the other.</p>

<p>The appearances above described will shortly afterwards
succeed, but not so soon as in the former experiment,
and if the transfusion be stopped, the animal which
has been asphyxiated in this way, may recover and live.
In the preceding experiment he will always die. It
appears then that some extraneous pernicious principle is
imbibed by the venous blood, when in contact with the
air. Observe that for the latter experiment the dog from
which the brain of the other is to be injected, must be
stronger and more vigorous than the other. The reasons
are evident.</p>

<p>I was desirous of trying whether the venous blood
would not be capable of keeping up the cerebral action,
if reddened artificially. For this purpose I opened the
jugular and the carotid of a dog, and received the blood
of the vein in a vessel filled with oxygen; it immediately
became of a vivid purple, but on its injection into the
brain, the animal was very suddenly killed. I was much
surprised at this result, but ceased to be so on remarking,
that a great quantity of air was mixed with the fluid,
and that it arrived upon the brain, in a state of foam:
now we know that a very small number of bubbles are
sufficient to kill an animal, whether they be introduced
on the side of the brain, or on that of the heart.</p>

<p>From this reflection, I was induced to repeat my experiments
upon the injection of black blood, suspecting as
I did that some small quantity of air might in these cases<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
have been contained in the extremity of my syringe. I
soon however recollected that if this cause were real, it
should produce the same effect in every instance whatever
were the fluid employed, now when water is injected
there is nothing of the kind observable.</p>

<p>We may be thus assured that the black blood is either
incapable of keeping up the action of the brain, or that
it acts in a deleterious manner upon that organ, from the
very nature of the principles, which it contains. From
such datum it should appear that the life of the asphyxiated
person might be restored, by pushing on into the
brain a sufficient quantity of arterial blood, but here we
must make a distinction of two periods in asphyxia: 1st.
That in which the cerebral functions are only suspended:
2dly. That in which the circulation and the movements
of the breast are stopped (for this disease is ever characterised
by the sudden loss of all animal life, and consecutively
by that of the organic life.) Now, as long as
the first period of asphyxia continues, I have observed
that, by the transfusion of red blood into the brain, from
the heart of another animal, the movement of the creature
which is dying will be restored by degrees, and the
cerebral functions resume in part their activity; but this
is only a temporary thing, and the animal will fall again
into its previous dying state, if the asphyxiating cause be
continued.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if during the first period, to which
we have alluded, the air be readmitted, into the trachea,
the lungs will be reanimated, the blood be coloured, and
the creature be revived without the assistance of any
transfusion; and such transfusion again is of no avail,
after the second period of asphyxia, so that this experiment
offers only a proof of what we already know; with
respect to the difference of the influence of arterial and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[248]</a></span>
venous blood upon the brain, and not a remedy in case
of asphyxia.</p>

<p>Again, whenever I have injected venous blood into
the brain, by the help of a syringe, I have universally
found that such proceeding is fatal. Though the cause of
asphyxia be removed, and arterial blood injected, either
with the syringe, or immediately from the heart of another
animal, it is of little effect, and frequently of none whatever.
And in general asphyxia when produced by blood,
which has been taken from the venous system itself and
pushed into the brain is much more certain and more
decided, than that which is occasioned by ligature of the
trachea, or the introduction of different gases into the
lungs.</p>

<p>After having established by different experiments, how
fatal the influence of the black blood is upon the brain,
which receives it from the arteries whenever the chemical
functions of the lungs are suspended, it will not be amiss
or out of place to shew, that the phenomena of the
asphyxia, which are observed in the human subject,
accord with the experiments of which I have given the
detail.</p>

<p>1st. It is generally known that every kind of asphyxia
affects the brain in the first instance; that the functions
of this organ are the first to be annihilated; that the
animal life, and particularly the sensations cease; that all
our relations with exterior objects are instantly suspended,
and that the organic functions are only consecutively
interrupted. Whatever be the mode of asphyxia, by
submersion, strangulation, gases, or a vacuum, the same
phenomena occur at all times.</p>

<p>2dly. It is known that the greater number of those
who have escaped suffocation, have been sensible only of
a general stupor, the seat of which has been evidently in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[249]</a></span>
the brain. It is known also, that death is almost always
certain in these cases, while the pulse and the heart have
ceased to be felt.</p>

<p>3dly. It is affirmed by almost all such persons as have
survived this accident, especially when caused by the
vapour of charcoal, that the first thing of which they
were sensible, was more or less pain, in the head, an effect
in all probability occasioned by the first influx of the
black blood into the brain. This fact has been noted by
the greater number of authors, who have written on
asphyxia.</p>

<p>4thly. The vulgar expression that “charcoal flies to
the head” is surely a proof that the brain, and not the
heart, is the first affected in the asphyxia occasioned by
this deleterious substance. The unprejudiced vulgar,
oftentimes observe more correctly than we do, who frequently
see only what we wish to see.<a name="FNanchor_93_93" id="FNanchor_93_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a></p>

<p>5thly. There are many examples of persons, who after
escaping the pernicious effects of the vapour of charcoal,
have been subject afterwards to paralytic affections, and
loss of memory. Such changes have evidently their seat
in the brain. Convulsion also is frequently the effect of
the impression of mephitic vapour: head-ache is a common
symptom, and for the most part remains after the
others have disappeared. In every book of cases may
be seen examples of these affections.</p>

<p>In cold-blooded animals, and in reptiles especially, this
influence of the black blood on the brain, though real, is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[250]</a></span>
much less apparent. Make an incision into both sides
of the breast of a frog, then tie the lungs at their root,
and the animal will live notwithstanding for a considerable
time. Cut away the lungs entirely, and the same
phenomenon will be remarked. In fish, the relation
between the lungs and the brain, is somewhat more
direct, for by the organization of the branchiæ, they
differ essentially from reptiles. I have taken away the
cartilaginous plate which covers the gills of the carp,
the motion of the gills however continued to be made as
before, and the animal lived without any apparent injury
done to its functions. I afterwards put a ligature about
the cartilaginous rings which sustain the branchiæ, so as
to hinder all motion in the pulmonary apparatus. The
effect was, that the animal languished, his fins dropt,
his muscular movements soon grew weak, then ceased
entirely, and the creature in the course of a quarter of an
hour was dead. The same phenomena with some little
variety, were observable in a carp from which I cut away
the branchiæ.</p>

<p>After all however, the particular nature of those relations,
which unite the heart, the lungs, and the brain,
both in the red and cold-blooded animals, is well worthy
the farther investigation of physiologists. The latter sort
of animals, can neither be subject to syncope or apoplexy,
or at least the character of these diseases must be
very much modified in them. They are with much more
difficulty asphyxiated. We shall now return to those
species which bear a nearer resemblance to man.</p>

<p>From the influence of the black blood over the heart,
the brain, and the rest of the organs, it was my opinion,
that persons affected with varicose aneurisms, would
perish less quickly from asphyxia then others; because
the red blood passes into the veins, and traverses the lungs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[251]</a></span>
without requiring alteration. Accordingly, it should be
capable of keeping up the cerebral action.</p>

<p>To be assured if this suspicion were well founded, I
made a communication between the carotid artery and
jugular vein of a dog, by means of a curved tube. The
pulsation of the artery was thus communicated to the
vein. I afterwards asphyxiated the animal by stopping
the trachea, but the phenomena of death were little different
from those of common asphyxia.</p>

<p>We may conclude with certainty, from the various
considerations and experiments presented in the present
chapter.</p>

<p>1st. That when the chemical phenomena of the lungs
are interrupted, the black blood acts upon the brain, as it
does upon the heart, by penetrating the tissue of that
organ, and depriving it of the excitement, which is necessary
to its action.</p>

<p>2dly. That its influence is much more rapid upon the
first, than on the second of these organs.</p>

<p>3dly. That it is the inequality of such influence, which
occasions the difference in the cessation of the two lives
in the case of asphyxia. The animal life is always annihilated
before the organic life.</p>

<p>We may conceive from what has been said in this and
the preceding chapter, how unfounded are the suspicions
of those who have supposed that the brain, after the separation
of the head from the body by the guillotine, might
live awhile and have sensation. The action of this organ
is immediately connected with its double excitements.&mdash;1st,
By motion; 2dly, By the nature of the blood which
it receives. Now, when the interruption of such excitement
is sudden, the interruption of every kind of feeling
must also be sudden.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[252]</a></span></p>

<p>When the chemical functions of the lungs are suspended,
the disturbance induced in the functions of the brain,
has indeed a very considerable influence on the death of
the other organs; nevertheless, such disturbance is the
beginning of death only in the animal life, and even then
is connected with other causes. The organic life ceases
from the sole presence of the black blood among the different
organs. The death of the brain is only an isolated
and partial phenomenon of asphyxia, which does not take
place in any particular organ, but in all alike. We shall
explain this assertion in the following chapter.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_91_91" id="Footnote_91_91"></a><a href="#FNanchor_91_91"><span class="label">[91]</span></a> In a preceding article, Bichat maintains that the entrance of the
arterial blood contributes to support the action of the brain, principally
by the jar which it communicates to this organ. It is astonishing, after
this, that he should attribute the suspension of the cerebral functions to
the interruption of the chemical phenomena of respiration rather than
to that of the mechanical phenomena. He could not however be
ignorant, that it is to the last that must be referred the greatest of the
two motions with which the brain is constantly agitated.
</p>
<p>
These motions of the brain in relation with those of respiration have
been for a long time observed. Schitling has described them in a
memoir inserted in the first volume of the Memoirs of Learned Foreigners.
He has shown that the brain rises in expiration, and flattens in inspiration.
Haller, Lamure and Lorry have since him investigated this motion,
and they have given an explanation of it, which is defective only
because they have been ignorant of the influence of respiration on the
acceleration of the course of the blood in the arteries through the
medium of the capillary vessels.
</p>
<p>
At the time of a strong expiration, all the pectoral and abdominal
organs are compressed, and the arterial blood is forced more especially
into the branches of the ascending aorta. This blood goes then in
greater abundance towards the head, and has a tendency to pass more
quickly in the veins which carry it towards the heart; which would
take place immediately if the veins were free. But the pressure
made on the pectoral organs has also made the venous blood flow back
in the vessels which contain it. Now, this blood has just met that
which comes from the arteries; the vessel is distended, and the course
of the fluid is arrested in the veins; from that the brain swells and rises
up; but as soon as expiration has ceased, the dilatation which takes place
in the chest attracts, in some measure, the blood of the superior venæ
cavæ; the veins which enter it are soon emptied and the brain flattens
down.
</p>
<p>
In reflecting on the mechanism by which this movement of the brain
is effected by the influence of respiration, we cannot perceive why the
phenomenon should be limited to the organ contained within the
cranium, and especially why the spinal marrow should not equally
partake of it. The continuity of this organ with the cerebrum and
cerebellum, its situation in a cavity which it does not entirely fill, the
numerous arteries which it receives from the intercostal and vertebral
arteries, the number and size of its veins destitute of valves are so many
circumstances which should favour the accumulation of the blood
at the time of expiration, and consequently produce its swelling. For
the purpose of seeing if my conjectures were well founded, I have
made some experiments; I laid bare in a young rabbit the spinal marrow
at about the eighth or ninth dorsal vertebra, I saw it perfectly whole
and surrounded by its coverings. At first I perceived no motion, but
soon the animal being much incommoded by the position in which I
kept him, made a deep inspiration, and then I saw distinctly the spinal
marrow flatten, and a small vacuum between the dura mater and the
osseous parietes of the vertebral canal. In the following expiration,
the spinal marrow resumed its original size. I was unable to see any
thing more in this animal.
</p>
<p>
I laid bare in a dog of middle size, the spinal marrow, a little above
the lumbar region; I could not mistake there a very evident motion,
in relation with respiration: a flattening during inspiration, and a swelling
during expiration. The phenomenon was so marked, that the air
entered the vertebral canal with a noise, whilst the animal inspired, and
was forced out when the animal expelled the air from his lungs.
</p>
<p>
For the purpose of satisfying myself that this motion took place in the
spinal marrow and not in the dura-mater, I cut this membrane in the
whole extent of the opening made in the vertebral canal, and I was
able easily to convince myself that the motion was from the swelling
of the spinal marrow. I am not however certain that there is not a
slight rising of the organ from the dilatation of the large veins in the
anterior part of the vertebral canal, but this dilatation cannot be considerable,
on account of the fibrous layer which covers the posterior face
of these veins.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_92_92" id="Footnote_92_92"></a><a href="#FNanchor_92_92"><span class="label">[92]</span></a> Active substances introduced into the veins can act on the organs
in many ways at once. They have at first their peculiar action which is
nearly uniform, whatever may be the mode of administration; but they
produce also other effects resulting from their physical properties, and
these last may vary according to the form in which they are introduced.
</p>
<p>
The substances introduced into the circulation have necessarily to
pass through a double system of capillary vessels, and must consequently
be very greatly subdivided. Hence we see that a viscid fluid
would be unable to enter the smallest vessels, and that by remaining in
those which can admit it, it will prevent the passage of the blood, and
occasion a congestion either of the lungs or some other organ, according
as it has been injected into a vein or an artery. A substance like
quicksilver, which without being viscid, exhibits great cohesion among
its particles, will produce precisely the same effects. The globules
will never divide below a certain size. The air itself, mixed in a fluid
such as the blood, will form bubbles which will divide with more difficulty
as they become smaller, and which can finally stop in the entrance
of the capillaries, so as to prevent a free passage of blood in a part of
these vessels. Boerhaave thought that it was always thus, by opposing
a mechanical obstacle to the capillary circulation of the lungs, that air
injected into the veins produced the death of the animal.
</p>
<p>
In an experiment in which I proposed to myself to change the nature
of the blood by a foreign fluid, I injected into the jugular vein of a
dog, an ounce of Olive oil, thinking that this substance would circulate
without inconvenience with the blood; but it was not so, and the
animal died in a few minutes after the injection.
</p>
<p>
In examining the organs after death, I saw that the oil had closed the
last ramifications of the pulmonary artery, and that it had also stopped
the circulation and respiration, by preventing the passage of the blood
to the left side of the heart, by the pulmonary veins. An injection
made with a thick solution of gum tragacanth produced precisely the
same phenomena as the oil.
</p>
<p>
An inert, impalpable powder, suspended in water, immediately produces
death, if injected into the jugular vein, because it shuts up the
last divisions of the pulmonary artery.
</p>
<p>
If the injected substances are not divided at first in the blood, so as
to spread uniformly into the different branches, death does not take
place so quickly, because a part of the sanguineous canals remains
free for the circulation. This is the case when we inject quicksilver
or air in so small a quantity as not to produce instantaneous death.
The congestion, in this last case, is often alone sufficient to produce it
after a certain time; in the other case, there is added to the obstruction
a real pneumonia caused by the presence of quicksilver in the obliterated
vessels. We shall now relate four experiments of M. Gaspard, which
will show the effects of the stagnation of this fluid in different organs.
</p>
<p>
“<em>First Experiment.</em> I introduced into the jugular vein of a small
dog, four days old, thirty six grains of quicksilver purified through goat’s
skin. Soon after he refused to suck, lost his vivacity, motility and heat,
had dyspnoea and fever, and died at the end of twenty four hours,
having been all the time much colder to the touch than the other pups
with whom he was. On opening the thorax, the lungs were found much
inflamed, almost hepatized, heavy, puckered up and full of mercury.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Second Experiment.</em> I injected into the left carotid artery of a
sheep, very near the brain, half an ounce of mercury with water; I
then tied with a double ligature the open vessel. The animal immediately
manifested pain, and was for an instant immoveable, the head
inclined, with stupor and a prominence of the eyes, which were extraordinarily
open; then bending on the fore legs, twisting of the head
and neck on the right shoulder, with a kind of stiffness or convulsive
elasticity, which was always present till death, and returned, as by
the effect of a spring, when I straightened the neck. Two hours
after, standing impossible, state of drowsiness, some convulsive motions
of the limbs, the left eye swelled, red and inflamed. The next day,
the same state, almost total annihilation of the animal or external life,
copious excretion of mucus by the left nostril, the eye still very large
and inflamed. The third day, the same state; death took place fifty
hours after the injection. On examination of the body it was found
that the left eye was in a state of suppuration and contained mercury;
the thyroid, pharyngeal auricular, lingual, labial, nasal and cerebral
arteries of the left side, were admirably injected with this metal which
run out under the instrument; but their capillary terminations contained
none of it, and we could see to what ramification, to what
sized caliber it had penetrated, and the point where it was unable to
pass; the left nasal cavities exhibited a very pretty reticulated appearance,
brilliant and silvery. Moreover all the organs of this side were
red, inflamed and swelled by the presence of the foreign body, and
it was curious to see the half of the thyroid gland, the tongue, the
cheeks and the lips thus red and inflamed to the median line, whilst
the other half was sound and pale; the left brain was slightly inflamed
and especially the plexus choroides. Besides, I was unable to discover
a globule of quicksilver in any of the other organs.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Third Experiment.</em> I forced with a pewter syringe into the crural
artery of a large dog, a drachm and a half of quicksilver mixed with
common water. The animal, immediately after the double ligature, did
not manifest any sign of pain, and walked, bearing less on that limb,
which was very sensibly cold, though not paralyzed. But about an
hour after, he refused food, manifested by piercing cries acute pain,
constant agitation, frequent change of place, and a very evident state
of suffering; the limb soon after grew warm, became hot to the touch,
with an obscure pulse under the tendo Achillis. This state of fever and
pain continued the whole day and night. The next day, the limb was
swollen and exhibited a phlegmonous œdema preserving the impression
of the finger; the plaintive cries were continual. On the third
day his condition was still worse, and I then killed him from compassion
sixty hours after the injection. I had carefully noticed the
matter of the excretions, without discovering a particle of quicksilver
in them. On examination of the body, I could not discover it in any
organ, except the limb subjected to the experiment, which was swollen,
inflamed and oedematous in all its textures; we observed abscesses
in it of different sizes, containing quicksilver, pus, sanies and much gas,
coming from the incipient gangrene of the parts; the metal usually
occupied the centre of all the abscesses; the mercurial globules flowed
out when I cut the skin, the cellular texture, the muscles and especially
the small arteries, which were admirably injected by it; gelatinous
exudations occupied the interstices of the muscles.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>Fourth Experiment.</em> I injected a drachm of quicksilver, that had
been passed through goat’s skin, into the mesentric vein of a dog of
middle size. The animal exhibited several severe symptoms which I
shall not mention, because they probably depended on the opening of
the abdomen and the inflammation that resulted from it; perceiving
that they would become fatal, I killed him by another experiment,
fifty two hours after the first. On opening the body, I found all the
mercury in the liver; each globule was the centre of a small collection
of pus, of which it was the cause; but the liver was but slightly diseased,
but little inflamed, and only blacker and more gorged with blood
than usual. The stomach contained an unusual quantity of very green
bile; I could not discover any quicksilver in the other organs.”
</p>
<p>
We see from all these different facts, that it is necessary for every
thing that enters the circulation to arrive at it by very narrow channels,
and after having been, as it were, sifted by the agents of absorption;
this is one use of the absorbent organs that has not as yet been noticed.
These facts also throw light on the properties of substances injected
into the veins of animals, after having been dissolved in oil. We can
believe that when these oily solutions are carried into the intestinal
canal, they are not absorbed till after they have been gradually changed
into a kind of emulsion, and we know that in this form fatty substances
may be introduced with impunity into the circulation. We can in fact
inject into the veins a large quantity of milk, and the portion of butter
which is suspended in it, will not produce the effects which would
necessarily result from it, if we injected this substance pure and only
rendered liquid by heat.</p></div>

<br />
<span class="fs50">OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE DEATH OF THE LUNGS OVER
THAT OF THE ORGANS IN GENERAL.</span></h3>


<p>I have just shewn in what way the interruption of the
chemical phenomena which take place in the lungs, annihilates
the functions of the heart and brain. It remains
me to shew, that the other organs of the body are as much
affected by such cessation; so that asphyxia, as I have
said, is a general disease, and not an affection of any one
organ in particular.</p>

<p>But before I proceed to analyze the effects of asphyxia
upon the organs in general, and consequently the mode of
action of the black blood upon them, it may be of use to
explain the phenomena of the production of this kind of
blood, at the instant when the functions of the lungs are
suspended. This paragraph will possess, perhaps, some
interest; it might have belonged indifferently to either of
the preceding chapters.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[253]</a></span></p>


<h4>I. <em>Exposition of the phenomena of the production of
black blood, when the chemical functions of the lungs
are suspended.</em></h4>

<p>It is known in general, that the blood is coloured in
traversing the lungs, that from black it becomes red; but
this very interesting fact, has not been hitherto the object
of any precise or rigorous experiment. The lungs of the
frog, of which the air vessels are large, and the membranes
thin and transparent, would serve very well for
the purpose of observing the process of the phenomenon
in question, but for the slowness of respiration in these
animals, the difference of organization in their lungs, and
the too small quantity of blood by which they are traversed.
On such account there can be little analogy between
them and the more perfect animals, and then again our
experiments upon these little amphibiæ, are all of them
rendered incomplete, by the tenuity of their pulmonary
vessels, and the impossibility of observing the correspondence
of the change of velocity in the circulation, with the
colour of their blood.</p>

<p>The phenomena of the respiration of man, and those of
the functions which are dependent on it, can be illustrated
only by experiments made upon animals with a double
ventricle, with a complete pulmonary apparatus, possessed
of a temperature superior to that of the atmosphere, and
the two separate systems of venous and arterial blood;
but on the other hand, in the mammalia resembling man,
their respiratory apparatus, the thickness of the vessels
and cavities of the heart, impede the view of the blood
which they contain; and experiments made without an
absolute inspection of the fluid there, can only give us
approximations. The indecisive experiments of former<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[254]</a></span>
physiologists on this subject were my motives for the
present inquiry.</p>

<p>One of the best methods of judging of the colour of the
blood, consists as I have often said, in fixing a tube with
a stop-cock to the trachea. By this, the influx of air into
the lungs, may be regulated or altogether stopped. By
this, we may distend the organ, or entirely evacuate it;
it gives us also the facility of introducing whatever gas
we please. The animal breathes very well by such pipe
when it is open, and would live with it for a considerable
length of time without any very great alteration in its
functions.</p>

<p>In the second place, an artery, the crural or carotid for
instance, must be opened with the view of observing the
varieties of colour in the blood projected from it. A
small artery should not be chosen. From such a one the
course of the blood would be suspended by the slightest
accident; and on the other hand, the larger arteries
expend in a little time too large a quantity of blood; this
inconvenience may be remedied, by adapting to these
vessels a tube of a small diameter, or a stop-cock.</p>

<p>All things being thus prepared, on a dog, for instance,
let us see what are the phenomena which take place, when
the colour of the blood is altered. In my indication
of these, however, I shall speak only of what I have
seen, and by no means pretend that in man their duration
should be similar or uniform, or even that in animals
of the same species, under the different circumstances of
sleep, digestion, exercise, and passion, &amp;c. if it were
possible in such way to repeat them, they should be alike.
The instability of the animal functions, as I have said, is
extreme; they cannot be submitted to calculation; they
remain indeed the same, but their variations as to plus or
minus are innumerable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">[255]</a></span></p>

<p>Let us now return to our subject:</p>

<p>1st. If the cock of the pipe be shut immediately after
the animal has inspired, the blood begins to be altered in
colour at the end of about thirty seconds.&mdash;At the end
of a minute its colour is dark; at the end of a minute
and half or two minutes, it is perfectly similar to venous
blood.</p>

<p>2dly. If the cock of the pipe be shut immediately after
the animal has expired strongly, the blood receives its
tinge of black some seconds the sooner.</p>

<p>3dly. If the air of the lungs be pumped out entirely
with a syringe, the blood will suddenly pass from red to
black.<a name="FNanchor_94_94" id="FNanchor_94_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> In such case it appears that the artery immediately
throws out a black stream, after it has expelled the
red blood which it previously contained. There is no
gradation. The blood is expelled by the arteries, such as
it is in the veins.</p>

<p>4thly. If, instead of making a vacuum in the lungs,
we inflate the air cells to the full, the blood is a longer
time in becoming black, a minute at least, and is not completely
black before the end of three minutes.&mdash;This will
vary according to the quantity of air injected.</p>

<p>From all these experiments it follows, 1st, That the
length of the interval, during which the blood retains
its red colour, is in direct proportion to the quantity of
air contained in the lungs; 2dly, That as long as there
remains any quantity however small of respirable air in
the cells of the lungs, the blood will preserve more or
less of its crimson colour; 3dly, That this colour diminishes
in proportion as the respirable air diminishes; and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[256]</a></span>
4thly, That the blood is exactly similar to that of the
veins, as soon as the whole of the vital air in the extremities
of the bronchiæ has been exhausted.</p>

<p>In my different experiments with regard to asphyxia,
I have remarked, that if after shutting the cock of the
syringe, the animal agitate the chest by similar movements
to those of inspiration and expiration, the blood
is a longer time in losing its red colour, than in the case
where the breast remains at rest. Such motion and
agitation must cause a circulation of air in the cells, in
consequence of which, a greater number of its points
must be presented to the circulating fluid. My experiments
which I shall presently detail on the breathing of
animals in bladders, will prove the truth of the above
explanation.</p>

<p>At present I pass to a contrary set of phenomena&mdash;to
those which are exemplified when the blood regains its
arterial colour during the period, which, from a state of
asphyxia, restores the animal to life.</p>

<p>1st. When the cock, which for some minutes has been
shut, is opened, the air immediately penetrates into the
bronchiæ; but previously the animal expires strongly.
Six or seven large inspirations and expirations follow
each other precipitately. The artery being now examined,
a jet of a very vivid colour is seen succeeding to the
efflux of black blood, and takes place in thirty seconds at
most, from the time of opening the tube. This is the
inverse of the phenomenon above described. There are
no successive shades perceived from black to red; the
passage is instantaneous. The brightness of the colour
seems even to be greater than is natural.</p>

<p>2dly. If instead of suddenly turning the cock, a very
strong stream of air only be admitted, the colour is less
lively indeed, but just as quickly regained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[257]</a></span></p>

<p>3dly. If there be adapted to the stop-cock a syringe
full of air, and this fluid be pushed into the lungs, on
opening the pipe, and then the pipe be suddenly shut
again, the blood will become red, but much less evidently
so, than when the entrance of the air is owing to voluntary
inspiration. Here the portion of air injected must
repel into the bottom of the cells whatever is already
vitiated, while on the contrary, if the tube be simply
opened, the vitiated air is at once rejected, and then
replaced from without. The following experiment appears
to confirm this idea.</p>

<p>4thly. If instead of pushing air upon that which is contained
in the lungs, we pump out the vitiated air in the
first place, and then inflate the organ, the colouring process
will be more rapid, and the colour of the blood
itself especially, more lively than in the preceding case,
though less so than in the first of this latter suite of experiments.</p>

<p>5thly. The lungs being exposed on both sides by a
lateral section of the ribs, the circulation will continue to
go on for a certain time. Now, if by means of a syringe
adapted to the stop-cock in the trachea, the pulmonary
vesicles be alternately emptied and dilated, the changes
from red to black, and from black to red, will be observed
as in the above experiment, as long as the circulation
lasts.</p>

<p>The following consequences may be inferred from the
facts, which I have mentioned.</p>

<p>1st. The rapidity with which the blood becomes red
again, on opening the pipe in the trachea, is a plain proof,
that the principle from which this colour is gained, must
pass into the blood across the membranous parietes of the
air cells, and not by means of the absorbents. I shall
establish this fact hereafter upon other proofs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[258]</a></span></p>

<p>2dly. The celebrated experiment of Hook, in which
the enfeebled movements of the hearts of animals in a
state of asphyxia are accelerated by injecting air into the
lungs, is very well explained. The red blood penetrates
into the fibres of the heart, and puts an end to the debility
induced, by the influx thither of the black blood.</p>

<p>3dly. I do not believe, that motion can ever be restored
to the heart, when once it has been wholly annihilated
by the presence of venous blood. In this I have never
succeeded, though I have often attempted it. Many
authors, however, pretend to have done so. If the heart
be reanimated by arterial blood, it is necessary at any
rate, that such blood, should pass into it, now in what
way can it arrive there, if the circulation have entirely
ceased.</p>

<p>We must observe, however, that there are two cases
of interruption in the action of the heart from asphyxia.
Sometimes there supervenes a syncope which arrests the
movement of this organ, before the black blood has been
able to produce such effect; and here it is manifestly
capable of excitement, from the presence of the red blood,
just as it is from the application of any irritating cause;
but when it has been injected with venous blood, it then
contains within itself the principle of its inertia, which
can be removed only by the contact of arterial blood with
it; but such contact is become impossible.</p>

<p>I was very desirous of knowing what the influence
might be of the different gases when inspired upon the
colour of the blood. Accordingly I successively adapted
to the pipe different bladders, containing hydrogen and
carbonic acid gas.</p>

<p>The animal alternately swells and contracts the bladder
by the different motions of the thorax. It is calm at first,
but at the end of three minutes, begins to be agitated; its<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[259]</a></span>
respiration is now hurried and embarrassed, and at the
end of four or five minutes, the blood of the carotid is
black.</p>

<p>Whichever of the two gases be employed, there is little
difference in the above phenomena. This remark should
be compared with those of the Members of the Institute,
who have assured us that complete asphyxia supervenes
only after an interval of ten minutes, with pure hydrogen,
and at the end of two minutes with carbonic acid gas.
The black blood must continue, therefore, to circulate for
a longer time in one than in the other kind of asphyxia
here spoken of. This circumstance confirms some reflections
which I shall have occasion to offer upon the difference
of asphyxiæ.</p>

<p>For what reason should the blood be a longer time in
losing its colour, when bladders of non-respirable air are
fixed to the pipe, than when the cock is simply turned?
The reason of this is evident. By the different motions
of the lungs, the air is expelled and reabsorbed, the respirable
portion of it must consequently be successively
presented to the capillary orifices, by which it is transmitted
to the blood.</p>

<p>On the contrary, when the pipe is simply shut, the air
it is plain has not the same influx and efflux; in comparison
with such motion, it may be said to stagnate so that
the respirable portion of that which is enclosed in the
bronchial cells is exhausted, and the blood ceases to be
coloured, though there remain in the trachea and its larger
divisions, a considerable quantity of fluid, which has not
been despoiled of its vivifying principle. Of this we
may be certain, after the death of the animal, by cutting
the trachea under the pipe, and plunging a bougie into
it. The process by which the blood gains its red colour
appears to take place only at the extremities of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[260]</a></span>
bronchiæ, the inner surface of the larger aerial vessels,
has nothing to do with this phenomenon.</p>

<p>We may convince ourselves of the reality of the explanation
which I have offered, if we pump out the air of
the lungs, before we fit the bladder to the trachea; for in
such case, the animal must breathe the air of the bladder
without mixture. Here the change of the blood to black
is almost sudden, but here also, as in the preceding experiment,
there is little difference in the phenomena, whatever
gas we employ. I have chosen the two gases above mentioned,
because they enter into the phenomena of natural
respiration.</p>

<p>When we adapt to the pipe a bladder full of pure
oxygen, the blood is very long in becoming black, but
does not at first assume a redder tint than it usually has.</p>


<h4>II. <em>The blood which has been blackened in consequence
of the interruption of the chemical functions of the
lungs penetrates into the organs, and circulates for
some time in the vascular system of the red blood.</em></h4>

<p>We have just established what are the phenomena of
the alteration of colour in the blood, when the chemical
functions of the lungs are suspended. Before we consider
the influence of this change upon the death of the organs,
let us prove, that they are really penetrated by the blood
when so altered.</p>

<p>I have proved it to be a fact, that the force of the heart
subsists for some time, notwithstanding the influx of the
black blood into it, and have shewn that the black blood
is thrown out with a jet, similar to that of the red blood,
&amp;c. &amp;c. Hence I might already conclude, 1st, That the
arterial circulation continues for a certain time, though
the arteries contain a fluid, to which they are not accustomed,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[261]</a></span>
and 2dly, That the necessary consequence of such
circulation, must be the injection of the different parts of
the body with black blood; but we shall deduce the latter
conclusion from precise and rigorous experiments. To
be certain of this important fact, we have only to expose
successively the different organs, while the animal is suffering
a death of asphyxia. I have in this way examined
the muscles, the nerves, the membranes and the viscera.
The following are the results of my observations.</p>

<p>1st. The colouring matter of the muscles, exists in the
body in two states&mdash;at liberty, or in a state of combination;
in the vessels, where it circulates with the blood,
or in the fibres, with which it is combined. It forms
especially the colour of the muscles, and in such state
undergoes no alteration from asphyxia; in its free state
it is blackened. The divided muscles furnish an infinity
of black drops, which are no other than indices of the
divided vessels. Such drops contrast with the red of
the muscles; but when circulating within them, are the
cause of that livid tint which they then present.</p>

<p>2dly. The nerves are habitually penetrated by a number
of small arteries, which creep along within their tissue,
and carry to them both excitement and life. In the state
of asphyxia the black blood by which they are traversed,
is announced by the dull brown, which succeeds to the
rosy-white, which is natural to them.</p>

<p>3dly. There are few parts, where the influx of the black
blood is more visible, than in the skin; the livid spots so
frequent in asphyxia, are only the effect of the obstacles
which it meets with, in its passage towards the general
capillary system, to the organic contractility of which it
is not a sufficient excitant. To this cause also is owing
the tumefaction of certain parts, such as the cheeks and
lips. This phenomenon we have seen already in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[262]</a></span>
lungs, they cannot be traversed by the blood and therefore
become in the last moments of life, the seat of a fulness,
which affects the whole of the capillary system there; but
for the reasons, which I have assigned, such fulness is
always more evident in the capillary system of the lungs,
than in that of the system in general.</p>

<p>4thly. The mucous membranes also, when the chemical
functions of the lungs are interrupted, exemplify a
similar phenomenon. The swelling of the tongue, observable
in those that have been drowned or hanged, or
asphyxiated by the vapour of charcoal, the lividity of
the membrane of the mouth, of the intestines, and the
bronchiæ which have also been remarked, depend on
no other cause. The following is a proof of this assertion:</p>

<p>Drag out of an animal a portion of the alimentary canal
and divide it in such way as to expose its inner surface.
Then shut up the pipe which has been previously adapted
to the trachea, and at the end of four or five minutes, a
brown tint will succeed to the red one, which is natural
to this surface.</p>

<p>5thly. I have made the same remark upon the fleshy
granulations of a wound, inflicted on an animal, for the
purpose of observing the manner in which they are coloured
by the black blood. In the two last experiments, this
phenomenon is slower in taking place than in many other
circumstances.</p>

<p>6thly. The alteration of colour in the serous membranes
is much more quickly effected than it is in the
mucous membranes. Of this we may assure ourselves by
comparatively examining the outer and inner surfaces of
the intestines, while the pipe in the trachea is shut; in
the serous membranes, the livid tint which they assume,
depends upon the vessels, which creep underneath them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[263]</a></span>
and not on the blood by which they are penetrated.
Now as these vessels are considerable, the black blood
must flow into them almost as soon as it is produced.
In the mucous membranes on the contrary, and in all
cicatrices, the colour which they take on in asphyxia, is
made by the capillary system of the membrane itself,
which system is much more tardy than the other, to
receive the black blood, and to be penetrated by it; so
much so indeed, as to refuse it in some parts. I have
many times seen the membrane of the nasal fossæ very
red in asphyxiated animals, while that of the mouth has
been quite livid, for there are parts into which as I have
said the black blood will not penetrate at all, and then
they preserve their natural colour. 2dly. There are
others into which it evidently passes, but where it stops,
and then a simple change of colour is observed, if it have
penetrated but in small quantity; and again, if it have
penetrated in a considerable quantity, together with such
change of colour, there will be observed a tumefaction of
the part. 3dly. In other cases, the black blood merely
traverses the parts, without stopping in the capillary
system, and passes at once into the veins, as the red blood
does.</p>

<p>In the first and second case, the general circulation
experiences an obstacle which puts a stop to it in the
general capillary system. In the third, which is much
more universal, it is in the capillaries of the lungs that
the blood is at last arrested, after having circulated in the
veins.</p>

<p>These two sorts of impediment coincide with each
other, in many instances. Thus in asphyxia, a part of
the black blood which circulates in the arteries stops
in the face, upon the mucous surfaces, in the tongue, and
in the lips, while the other, and much the larger quantity,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[264]</a></span>
finds no impediment in the general capillary system, and
is finally arrested in the lungs.</p>

<p>What is the reason, why certain parts of the capillary
system refuse to admit the venous blood, or if they admit
it, do not pass it on to the veins; while others are less
enfeebled by it, and transmit it as freely as ever. All
this must certainly depend on the relation existing between
the sensibility of each part and the venous blood.</p>

<p>I was desirous of making use of the power, which we
possess, of changing the colour of the blood, for getting
some insight into the influence of the circulation of the
mother, upon that of the fœtus; accordingly I procured
a bitch big with young, and asphyxiated her, by closing a
tube, adapted to the trachea. About four minutes after
she had ceased to breathe, I opened her; the circulation
was going on. I then cut into the matrix, and exposed
the cord of two or three of the fœtuses. The artery and
the vein, were both of them full alike of venous blood.</p>

<p>Had I been able to procure other bitches in a similar
state, I should have repeated this experiment in another
manner. I should in the first place have compared the
natural colour of the vein, with that of the artery. In
many of the young of the guinea pig, the difference
appeared to me to be much less than it is in the adult
animal. In many circumstances indeed I could perceive
no difference whatever. Both the arterial and venous
blood were equally black, though the respiration of the
mother was in no wise impeded by the opening of the belly.
Secondly, I should have closed the tube in the trachea, and
then have observed whether the change in colour of the
umbilical artery of the fœtus (supposing the blood of the
artery to be different from that of the vein) were correspondent
with that, which would inevitably take place in
the blood of the mother. Experiments made with a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[265]</a></span>
view to these circumstances, and on large animals, might
probably throw much light upon the mode of communication,
between the mother and the fœtus. Observations
are also much to be desired, with respect to the colour of
the blood in the human fœtus, and the cause of its passage
from a livid colour, to the very marked red which it
assumes, some little time after birth.<a name="FNanchor_95_95" id="FNanchor_95_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a></p>

<p>I might add a number of examples to these, which I
have already related of the blackening of the organs by
the venous blood. Thus, the kidney of a dog exposed,
while the animal is dying of asphyxia, is much more
livid than in its natural state, the spleen also and the liver,
when divided, emit only black blood, instead of that
mixture of red and black blood which is observable, in
the section of these organs, upon an animal which breathes
freely.</p>

<p>But I trust that we have facts enough to establish it as
a certainty, 1st, That the black blood after the interruption
of the chemical functions of the lungs, continues for
some time to circulate, and 2dly, That it penetrates into
the organs, where it replaces the red blood; these circumstances
explain the reason, why on opening the body we
always meet with black blood even in the vessels which
are destined for the circulation of arterial blood.</p>

<p>In the last moments of existence of whatever death
the individual may have died, we shall always observe the
lungs become embarrassed and cease to perform their
office, for some time previous to the total suspension of
the functions of the heart. The blood makes its circle
through the system, after ceasing to receive the influence
of the air, and consequently in its venous state; accordingly
it must remain so in the organ in every case, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[266]</a></span>
the circulation be much less evident, than in asphyxia, for
it is in this circumstance that consists, the great peculiarity
of asphyxia. The following phenomena may now be
easily understood.</p>

<p>1st. When the left auricle and ventricle together with
the large divisions of the aorta, on opening the body,
are found to contain blood, such blood is always black.
The fact is familiar to those who are in the habit of
dissecting. In exercising my pupils on the surgical operations,
I have always observed that when the open arteries
are not entirely empty, their contents are composed of
venous blood.</p>

<p>2dly, The corpus cavernosum is always gorged with
this sort of fluid, whether flaccid or in a state of erection.
For I have seen it in the latter state in two subjects
brought to my amphitheatre. One of these men had
hanged himself, the other had died of concussion of the
brain.</p>

<p>3dly, The blood which is found in the spleen is never
red; but sometimes on the exterior, and sometimes on
the concave surface of this organ, I have observed spots
of a scarlet colour, for which I cannot account.</p>

<p>4thly, After death, the mucous membranes lose the
red colour by which they are characterized during life.
They assume a black and livid hue.</p>

<p>5thly, Blood extravasated in the brain of persons in a
state of apoplexy, is almost always found to be black.</p>

<p>6thly, Sometimes, instead of accumulating inwardly
the blood injects the surface of the body. In such case
the face, the neck, and shoulders swell, and are infiltrated
with blood. I have frequently remarked this sort of
phenomenon in the subject, but have never found it coincide
with any internal extravasion.&mdash;The colour of the
skin is then of a purple or deep brown, an evident sign<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[267]</a></span>
of the sort of blood with which it is injected, and is
evidently produced by the stagnation of the black blood
in the external capillary system, not by the reflux of the
blood from the veins.</p>

<p>I shall not dwell any longer upon the numerous consequences
of the above established principle. I shall only
observe, that when death commences by the circulatory
system, the preceding phenomena are not to be remarked,
or at least very little perceptible.</p>

<p>Let us now pass on to the influence of the black blood
upon the organs of which it penetrates the tissue.</p>


<h4>III. <em>The black blood which penetrates the organs, as
soon as the chemical functions of the lungs have
ceased, will not maintain them in a state of life and
activity.</em></h4>

<p>To determine what the influence of the black blood is
upon the organs, I shall first remark, that the property of
the red blood is to stimulate them, and keep up their vital
actions. This will be proved by the following observations:</p>

<p>1st, Compare phlegmon, erysipelas, and inflammatory
tumours (to the formation of which the red blood is
essentially requisite) with scorbutic spots, and petechiæ,
produced by the black blood. The first will be found
connected with the exaltation of the vital powers, the
second with their depression.</p>

<p>2dly, Examine two men, the one with a rosy coloured
skin and large breast, announcing vigour of lungs, the
other with a pale and sallow countenance, and narrow
chest: in these the vigour of the chemical combinations
which are made in the lungs, should certainly be very
different.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[268]</a></span></p>

<p>3dly, The greater number of gangrenes in old men,
begin with a lividity in the part, a lividity which is
evidently the index of the absence or diminution of the
arterial blood in the part.</p>

<p>4thly, The redness of the branchiæ of fish is always
the sign by which their vigour may be recognised.</p>

<p>5thly, The redder the granulations of wounds, the
more healthy is their nature; the paler or browner they
are, the less has the part a tendency to cicatrise.</p>

<p>6thly, The lively colour of the face, and the ardent
eye, coincide with the energy of the cerebral actions in
certain fevers.</p>

<p>7thly, The more developed the pulmonary system of
animals, the more active are the chemical processes of the
lungs, and the more developed and perfect the general
life of their different organs.</p>

<p>8thly, Youth, which is the age of vigour, is that also
when the red blood predominates in the system. The
arteries of old people are smaller, the veins larger than
those of the young. It is a fact universally known, that
at the two extremities of life the proportions of the two
vascular systems are inverted.</p>

<p>I am ignorant of the manner in which the red blood
excites and keeps up the life of the parts. Perhaps the
principles by which it is coloured become combined with
the different organs to which it is distributed. In fact
there is a considerable difference between the phenomena
of the general and those of the capillary system.</p>

<p>In the first, the blood in changing its colour, leaves
behind it the principles which made it red; in the second,
the elements to which its blackness is owing, are rejected
by respiration and exhalation. Now, this union of the
colouring principles of the arterial blood, may probably
constitute a material part of the excitement which is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[269]</a></span>
necessary to the action of the organs.&mdash;If such be the
case, the black blood as it does not contain the materials
of such union, cannot act as an exciting cause. This idea,
however, I offer only as a probability, and am by no
means prepared to defend it as a truth; it may be ranked
on a par with that of the sedative action, which I have
said may be excited by the black blood on the different
parts&mdash;for, however probable an opinion may appear,
there should be no real importance attached to it as an
opinion only.</p>

<p>Without regard then to any system, let us inquire
how the black blood, from its contact with the various
parts, is the occasion of their death; how it acts on the
parts of the animal life, and how it acts on those of the
organic life.</p>

<p>All the organs of the animal life depend upon the
brain; now, we have seen that the black blood paralyses
the cerebral powers almost suddenly. In the state then
of asphyxia, the locomotive, the vocal and sensitive
organs, must be inactive. From the same cause, their
exercise must be suspended in all those different experiments
where black blood is injected into the brain, the
other parts receiving the red blood as usual. But when
the black blood circulates throughout all the system,
when the whole of the organs, as well as the brain, are
submitted to its influence, then there are two other causes
of death connected with those which have been mentioned.</p>

<p>1st, The nerves, which are penetrated by it, for that
very reason are no longer capable of keeping up the communication
between the brain and the senses on the one
hand, and on the other, between this same viscus and the
locomotive or vocal organs.</p>

<p>2dly, The contact of the black blood with these organs
themselves annihilates their actions. Inject the crural<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[270]</a></span>
artery of an animal with the black blood taken from one
of its veins, and the movements of that member will be
shortly afterwards enfeebled, or wholly paralyzed. In
this experiment, the upper part of the artery, for manifest
reasons, should be that to which the pipe of the syringe
should be fixed.</p>

<p>I am aware that as to this experiment, it may be asserted
that the ligature of the artery, of itself, is capable
of paralyzing the limb. In fact, such circumstance has
happened twice with me, but I have also had occasion to
observe, that it does not necessarily follow the ligature
of this vessel, as it does the ligature of the aorta: when
the latter vessel is tied, all movements cease at once;
notwithstanding all which, the result of the injection of
black blood, is almost constantly that which I have asserted
it to be;&mdash;I say almost, 1st, Because I have once seen
it fail in its effect, though done with the requisite precautions;
2dly, Because the debility, which is induced, both
in duration and degree, will be according to the strength
of the animal on which the experiment is made.</p>

<p>There is also occasioned in this experiment, a manifest
suspension of the sensibility of the animal; it is not
indeed so ready to appear as the loss of motion; but it
always comes on, especially if the injection of the black
blood be repeated three or four times, with small intervals.</p>

<p>A similar, but a more tardy effect may be produced
by adapting to the canula, which has been placed in the
crural artery of an animal, a tube which has been previously
fixed to the carotid of another animal, and then
by asphyxiating the latter.<a name="FNanchor_96_96" id="FNanchor_96_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> The organs of the internal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[271]</a></span>
life are not dependent on the brain, and therefore are
not affected by the suspension of the cerebral action in
asphyxia. It is the influx of the black blood which is the
immediate cause of their death.</p>

<p>I have already demonstrated what the influence is of
this blood upon the organs of the circulation. We have
seen how the heart ceases to act, as soon as it is penetrated
by it; it is owing in part to the injection of the arterial
and venous parietes themselves, by the vasa vasorum, that
the vessels are forced to suspend their actions.</p>

<p>It will be always a difficult thing to prove, that the
secretions, the exhalations, and the process of nutrition,
could not be made from venous blood, because the circulation
of this sort of blood in the arteries, does not continue
for a sufficient time, to allow of observations, or the
manner in which these functions would be affected by it.
On this subject, however, I have made some essays. 1st,
I exposed the inner surface of the bladder of a living
animal, after having previously divided the symphysis
pubis, and opened the lower belly, I then examined the
oozing of the urine from the orifices of the ureters,
while I asphyxiated the animal. 2dly, I divided the vas
deferens, with the view of observing, whether the semen
would flow or not, during such state.</p>

<p>In general, I have had occasion to remark, that during
the circulation of the black blood in the arteries, no fluids
appear to issue from the different secreting tubes. But I
confess, that in all these experiments, and in other similar
ones which I have made, the animal is too much agitated,
and the limits of the experiments too circumscribed, for
any thing like a well founded judgment to be formed
on the subject in question. It is chiefly from analogy,
then, that I am led to conclude, that the black blood is
unfit for the purposes of exhalation and nutrition: such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[272]</a></span>
supposition also accords well with divers of the phenomena
of asphyxia.&mdash;1st, The want of exhalation from
the skin during the state of asphyxia, is probably the
reason of the phenomena of the animal heat in such sort
of death.<a name="FNanchor_97_97" id="FNanchor_97_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> 2dly, In asphyxiating animals very slowly
during digestion, I have uniformly observed, that the bile
ducts, and duodenum, contain a much less quantity of bile,
than they do at such time, when these parts are exposed
in the living animal.&mdash;3dly, As the blood loses nothing
from the exercise of these functions, it must of course
accumulate in the vessels; and in fact, it is very fatiguing
and unsatisfactory, to dissect the bodies of those who
have been hanged or asphyxiated with the vapours of
charcoal, from the fluidity and abundance of their blood.
But this abundance, perhaps, may depend upon the
weakness of the absorbents. In other sorts of death, the
absorbents continue for some time to act upon the serous
portion of the blood remaining in the vessels. In asphyxia
there is neither secretion nor absorption.</p>

<p>The excretions also appear to be affected much in the
same way. The bladder of asphyxiated persons has been
observed by Portal, to be very much distended. Such
distension, no doubt is occasioned by the urine already
secreted before the accident which was the cause of their
deaths. In general, the asphyxiæ which are occasioned
by the circulation of the black blood unmixed with any
deleterious substance, are not accompanied with those
spasms, which in so many other sorts of death, are so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[273]</a></span>
frequent. These spasms, which evacuate the organs of
their fluids, should be carefully distinguished from the
simple relaxations of the sphincters, by which analogous
effects are produced.<a name="FNanchor_98_98" id="FNanchor_98_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> In asphyxia, all is debility, in
asphyxia, we never see that augmentation of life, that
development of power, which so frequently mark the
latter movements of the dying.</p>

<p>Hence also perhaps, the great flexibility of the members
of asphyxiated persons. The stiffness of the muscles
appears to depend in many cases, on the circumstance of
death having come on precisely at the moment of their
contractions. The fibres remain approximated, and coherent
among themselves;<a name="FNanchor_99_99" id="FNanchor_99_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> in asphyxia, on the contrary, as
there exists an universal relaxation and want of action in
the parts, they remain so after death, and yield to whatever
impulse may be communicated to them.</p>

<p>I confess, however, that this explanation is subject to a
difficulty which I cannot solve. Persons asphyxiated by
mephetic vapours, perish nearly in the same way as those
who are drowned; if the cause of their death be different,
its effects are the same, as may be seen by opening the
carotid of two dogs at the same time, that into the lungs
of the one are injected the vapours of charcoal, and into
those of the other, a certain quantity of water, which
water, as in the drowned, is soon reduced into a state of
foam.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[274]</a></span></p>

<p>Notwithstanding this similitude of the last phenomena
of life in the two cases, the members in the first remain
for a certain time warm and supple, while those in the
second, especially if the body be plunged into water
during the experiment, become very suddenly stiff and
frozen. Let us return, however, to our subject. We
may conclude from the various facts and considerations
related in this chapter, 1st, That when the chemical
functions of the lungs are suspended, the functions of all
the other organs are suspended also, from the presence
of black blood within their substance. 2dly, That the
death of the organs in general, coincides with that of
the brain, and the heart, but is not immediately derived
from them. 3dly, That if it were possible for the brain
and heart to receive an influx of arterial blood, while
the others were dying, from that of the venous blood,
they would doubtless continue to exert their accustomed
actions. 4thly, That, in a word, asphyxia is a general
phenomenon, developed at the same time in all the organs,
but especially in one of them.</p>

<p>From this manner of regarding the influence of the
black blood upon the different parts of the body, it appears
that death is very soon the result of its circulation in the
arteries. Nevertheless, certain organic defects have
sometimes prolonged after birth, the mixture of the two
sorts of blood, a mixture which is known to be made in
the fœtus. Such was the malconformation mentioned
by Sandeford, in a child, the aorta of which arose by a
branch from each of the ventricles. Such also appears,
at first sight, to be the opening of the foramen ovale in
the adult.</p>

<p>We shall remark, however, that the existence of this
foramen, does not suppose the passage of the black blood
into the red-blooded auricle, as is generally believed.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">[275]</a></span>
For the two semi-lunar valves, between which it is situated
when met with after birth, are necessarily applied to
each other by the pressure which the blood contained in
the auricles, exercises upon them, when these cavities are
simultaneously contracted. The foramen must be at such
time shut, and its obliteration much more exact, than that
of the opening of the ventricles, by the mitral and tricuspid
valves, or that of the aorta and the pulmonary artery,
by the sigmoid valves. With all this, the foramen ovale
is actually very often found open in the subject, and when
not so, nothing is easier than to destroy the species of
adhesion which is contracted by the two valves which
close it. This may be done with the handle of a scalpel,
without any solution of continuity, the parts appear to be
unglued.</p>

<p>The oval hole when in this way artificially made, presents
the same disposition, with that which is sometimes
exemplified in the carcase. Now if this disposition be
examined, it will be seen that when the auricles contract,
the blood must make an obstacle to itself, and that it
cannot pass from one into the other of these cavities. It is
an easy thing to be convinced of the mechanism of which
I speak, by means of two injections of a different colour,
made at the same time from both sides of the heart, from
the vena cava, and the pulmonary veins.</p>

<p>From what we have said of the influence, which is
exercised by the movement and the different principles
of the blood, it is evident that the death of the white
organs must be different from that of the red ones.
Asphyxia can hardly reach them, but of the manner in
which they die I confess that I know but little.</p>

<br />
<span class="fs50">OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE DEATH OF THE LUNGS, OVER
THE GENERAL DEATH OF THE BODY.</span></h3>


<p>In recapitulating what has been said in the preceding
chapters, with respect to the influence of the lungs over
the heart, the brain, and all the organs, it is an easy
matter to form an idea of the successive termination of
the whole of the functions, when the phenomena of respiration
are suspended either mechanically or chemically.</p>

<p>The following is the manner in which death supervenes,
when the mechanical phenomena of the lungs are interrupted,
either from the causes mentioned in the 5th
chapter, or from similar ones, such as the rupture of the
diaphragm, which I have twice had occasion to observe,<a name="FNanchor_100_100" id="FNanchor_100_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[277]</a></span>or from a fracture of a great number of the ribs, or the
sternum.</p>

<p>1st. The mechanical functions of the lungs cease. 2dly.
The chemical functions of the lungs cease also. 3dly.
The cerebral actions are put an end to. 4thly. The animal
life is interrupted. 5thly. The general circulation
is interrupted. 6thly. The capillary circulation is interrupted.</p>

<p>The phenomena of death, are differently concatenated,
when they begin by the suspension of the chemical
functions of the lungs: which may happen, 1st, From
breathing in a vacuum; 2dly, From the obliteration of
the passage of the trachea, by foreign substances introduced
into it, or by tumour from without, or strangulation,
accumulation of fluid in the air cells, &amp;c.; 3dly, From
different inflammatory affections, schirrhi, &amp;c. of the
cavities of the mouth or throat. 5thly, From want of
respirable air, as on the summit of high mountains. 6thly, From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[278]</a></span>
the introduction into the air cells of non-respirable
gases, &amp;c. &amp;c. In all these cases, the following is the
order of the phenomena of death.</p>

<p>1st. The chemical functions of the lungs are suspended.
2dly. The functions of the brain are interrupted. 3dly.
Sensation, locomotion, the voice, the mechanical phenomena
of respiration cease. 4thly. The action of the
heart, together with the general circulation is annihilated.
5thly. The capillary circulation is put an end to, together
with the processes of secretion, exhalation, absorption,
and digestion. 6thly. The animal heat of the system
dies away.</p>


<h4>I. <em>Remarks upon the differences of asphyxiæ.</em></h4>

<p>The influence of the black blood as I have said, is
always the great agent in this double sort of death, but
it is not the only one: if that were the case, the phenomena
of all the asphyxiæ would be alike. It is true
that in every sort of asphyxia, the black blood ceases to
become red blood, and circulates in the arteries, such as
it is in the veins; but notwithstanding the uniformity of
this phenomenon, there can be nothing more varied, than
the symptoms and progress of these accidents. In some
of them, death is long in taking place; in others, almost
instantaneous: the phenomena developed in the last
moments of existence, are alike in none of them. The
state of the organs, and that of the powers which they
preserve after death, are as various.</p>

<p>1st, Asphyxia varies with respect to its duration; in
sulphurated hydrogenous gas, in nitrous gas, and certain
vapours arising from privies and sewers, it is quick in
taking place. In carbonic acid gas, azote, in pure hydrogen,
water, and a vacuum, its progress is slower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[279]</a></span></p>

<p>2dly, Asphyxia varies with respect to its attendant
phenomena. At times, the animal is violently agitated
and suddenly convulsed; at others, it appears to lose its
powers gradually; to pass into a state of sleep, and from
sleep into a state of death. In comparing the numerous
effects arising from the vapours of sewers, from those of
charcoal, from the different gases, from drowning, and
other causes of asphyxia, we find them almost as various,
as the causes themselves.</p>

<p>3dly, The phenomena which make their appearance
after death, are as variable. Compare the cold and frozen
carcase of a drowned man, with the remains of one who
has been suffocated. Read the result of the different
experiments of the Institute, upon the affections of the
galvanic fluid in the different asphyxiæ; examine Halle’s
detail of the symptoms which accompany the mephitism
of sewers; approximate the numerous observations, which
are scattered about in the works of Portal, Louis, Haller,
Troja, Pechlin, Bartholin, and Morgagni; repeat the most
common experiments on the submersion, strangulation,
and suffocation of animals; and you will observe the
greatest difference in all these sorts of asphyxia, they are
each of them characterized, by a peculiar state of the
bodies of the animals, which have been submitted to
the experiment.</p>

<p>To inquire into the causes of such differences, we must
first divide the asphyxiæ into two classes. 1st, Into those
which happen from the simple want of respirable air, and
2dly, Into those, where to this first cause is joined also
that of the introduction of some deleterious substance
into the lungs.</p>

<p>In the first class, the immediate cause of death, appears
to be the simple presence of the black blood, in the various
parts of the body, the general effect of which is always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[280]</a></span>
the same, in whatever manner produced; accordingly, the
attendant symptoms and secondary results of all these
sorts of death, are nearly alike, their duration the same,
and if it varies, it varies only in consequence of the more
or less complete interruption of the passage of air into the
lungs.</p>

<p>This variety in the duration and intensity of the
asphyxiating cause, may nevertheless occasion some variety
in the symptoms also; such as a greater or less lividity
and swelling of the face, a more or less considerable
embarrassment of the lungs; but all these differences
indicate only so many modifications of the cause, 1st, A
man who is hanged, does not die as a man who is suffocated
by an inflammatory tumour, or a pea or bean which
perchance may have fallen into the trachea.<a name="FNanchor_102_102" id="FNanchor_102_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> 2dly, An
animal will perish much more slowly under a vessel of
air, than when the trachea is tied. 3dly, The symptoms
of asphyxia, when occasioned by a great rarefaction of air,
or by a suffocating heat, are much less slowly produced,
than where the cavity of the lungs is opened.</p>

<p>In all these cases the cause of death, namely the absence
of red blood in the arterial system, is simple and unique,
but according to the greater or less oxygenation of the
venous blood, will be the appearances after death, for the
longer the process of asphyxia endures, the less irritability
will there be found in the system.</p>

<p>But if the cause of asphyxia, have been the introduction
of some deleterious fluid into the lungs, then the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[281]</a></span>
variety of the symptoms will depend upon the difference
in the nature of the fluid. In these cases the cause is
of two kinds: 1st, There is no red blood in the system.
2dly, A pernicious fluid is present in the system. All
the gases however do not act as deleterious substances:
in pure hydrogen for instance, the animal perishes only
as it would from the want of respirable air.</p>

<p>But when a man in descending into a common sewer,
into a cellar, or into any place where putrid matters are
accumulated, falls into asphyxia at the moment when he
inspires their exhalations, and when such state is attended
with convulsive movements and extreme agitation, then
indeed, there must be something more in the cause of his
death, than a simple suspension of the chemical functions
of the lungs.</p>

<p>In fact, together with the mephitic vapour, there continues
to enter into the lungs a sufficient quantity of air
to keep up life and its different functions. 2dly, Supposing
even that the quantity of mephitic air were such as
to leave no place for the entrance of respirable air, still
the death ensuing should only be gradual, without agitation
and convulsion, were it occasioned only by the
absence of such air: now the very different way in which
it supervenes, very evidently indicates the action of a
deleterious substance, upon the animal œconomy.<a name="FNanchor_103_103" id="FNanchor_103_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a></p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[282]</a></span></p>
<p>These two causes then act together, in those asphyxiæ
which are produced by certain gases, sometimes the one
predominates, sometimes the other. If the deleterious
substance be violent, it kills before the action of the black
blood can have produced much effect, if weak, it is the
black blood, which is principally the cause of death.</p>

<p>The asphyxiæ then, which are produced by the gases,
differ only, in consequence of the nature of the deleterious
substance, which varies <span lang="la" xml:lang="la">ad infinitum</span>. In some of the
aeriform fluids indeed it is supposed to be known, but in
the greater number of them it is not so:<a name="FNanchor_104_104" id="FNanchor_104_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> I shall notice
therefore in a general way the effects, which result from
the action of the deleterious substance, remarking at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[283]</a></span>
same time, that the symptoms by which they are displayed,
are strongly or weakly marked, according to the age
and temperament of the individual.</p>

<p>Deleterious substances introduced into the lungs, together
with the mephitic vapours of which they form
a part, can act only in two ways. 1st, By affecting the
nerves of the lungs, which re-act on the brain. 2dly, By
passing into the blood, and exercising their influence, by
means of the circulation on the various organs of the
system.</p>

<p>I can easily believe that the simple action of such a
substance on the nerves of the lungs, may have a very
marked effect on the economy, and be capable of troubling
the functions of the system very sensibly; much indeed
in the same way as with some individuals a mere odour,
or the sight of a hideous object, will occasion syncope, in
the same way that an irritating enema will suddenly
awake the system into life, or the introduction of certain
substances within the stomach, will be felt throughout
the body, before such substances can have passed into the
circulatory torrent. We meet at every moment with
examples of these very remarkable phenomena, produced
by the simple impressions of foreign bodies on the mucous
surfaces; I cannot deny that deleterious substances may
act in the same way upon the nerves of the lungs, though
we must not exaggerate the sphere of this mode of action.<a name="FNanchor_105_105" id="FNanchor_105_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_105_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a></p>

<p>In fact, I am not acquainted with any one example,
where the contact of a deleterious substance with a
mucous membrane, has been the sudden cause of death.
It may indeed be productive of such effect after a certain
time, but never at the moment of its action; nevertheless,
in those asphyxiæ which are produced by mephitic<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[284]</a></span>
vapour, so rapidly does death come on, that the black
blood can scarcely have had the time to exert its influence
upon the body. The principal cause of the cessation of
the functions is manifestly the action of the pernicious
substance.</p>

<p>These considerations, then, incline me to believe, that
these substances pass into the blood through the lungs,
and that in circulating with the blood they carry to the
organs the immediate cause of their death. Such passage
into the blood has already been suspected by many physicians;
the truth of the fact appears to be indubitably
proved by the following reflections.</p>

<p>1st, It can hardly be doubted, that the poison of the
viper and many other venomous animals, and that the
saliva of rabid animals, pass into the system of the blood,
and are taken up either by the veins or the lymphatics.</p>

<p>2dly, It appears to be very certain, that a portion of the
atmospheric air is actually absorbed through the mucous
membrane of the lungs itself, and not by means of the
absorbent system. Now, if this be the case, I know not
what should hinder the passage of mephitic vapour in
the same way.<a name="FNanchor_106_106" id="FNanchor_106_106"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> We are not sufficiently acquainted with
the limits of the particular sensibility of the membrane
of the air cells, to say that it cannot give a passage to
such vapour.</p>

<p>3dly, The respiration of an air which has been charged
with the exhalations arising from oil of turpentine, communicate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[285]</a></span>
a particular smell to the urine. It is thus that
this fluid is affected from the residence of the persons in
a newly varnished room. In this case it is evidently
by the lungs in part, that the odoriferous fluid has its
passage into the blood, and so on to the kidneys. In fact,
I have often assured myself by breathing out of a bottle
through a tube, air so charged (in which case it could not
act on the cutaneous surface) that the smell of the urine
undergoes a change. If, then, the lungs will admit a
variety of substances, which do not enter into the composition
of respirable air, for what reason should they not
admit the mephitic vapour of mines and subterraneous
places.</p>

<p>4thly, The respiration of humid air produces dropsy.
The extent of the fact has been exaggerated, indeed, but
the fact itself is true. It proves, that an aqueous fluid
may pass into the blood, and consequently that other
substances may pass into it also.</p>

<p>5thly, If an animal be asphyxiated in sulphurated hydrogenous
gas, and a plate of metal some time after its death
be placed under one of its muscles, the surface of the plate
contiguous to the muscle, will be sensibly sulphurated.
The foreign principle, then, which is here united with
the hydrogen, must have been introduced into the circulatory
torrent by the lungs, and have penetrated with the
blood into all the parts. The deputies of the Institute
have observed this phenomenon in their experiments. I
have made a similar remark in asphyxiating animals with
nitrous gas. A phenomenon of the same nature accompanies
the exhibition of mercury.</p>

<p>From the above, we have nearly a right to conclude,
that the different deleterious substances of which the gases
are the vehicles, do actually pass into the blood, and so
affect the organs. Of this matter, however, I shall
adduce some further proofs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[286]</a></span></p>

<p>I have ascertained by a number of experiments, that
atmospheric air, or any other aeriform fluid, may be made
to pass into the blood without alteration.</p>

<p>Divide the trachea of a dog, inject the air-cells strongly
with common air, and continue to retain it in the lungs.
The animal will immediately discover signs of great
distress and agitation; if an artery now be opened, the
blood will be emitted in a frothy state.</p>

<p>If hydrogen have been employed, it may easily be
ascertained that the nature of the fluid is unchanged, by
placing a candle over the bubbles which are disengaged.</p>

<p>When the blood for the space of thirty seconds has
flowed in this state, the animal life of the creature will
be finished, and death ensue, with all the symptoms which
accompany the insufflation of air into the black-blooded
system of vessels. The re-admission of air into the
lungs, will have no effect in restoring the animal to life,
for as soon as frothy blood can flow from any one of the
arteries, it must already have affected the brain with its
pernicious influence.</p>

<p>In this case it may be perceived, that the causes of death
are the same as those which proceed from the insufflation
of air into a vein. In the one instance the air passes
at once from the lungs into the arterial system. In the
other, from the veins across the lungs and then into the
arteries.</p>

<p>When we open the bodies of animals, which have been
killed in these experiments, the whole apparatus of the
red-blooded vascular system, is found to be filled with air
bubbles of various sizes. In some circumstances, the
blood will be transmitted in the same state into the general
capillary system, and from thence into the veins; in
others it will be stopped in the capillary system, and
in such cases, though the circulation may have continued<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">[287]</a></span>
for some time after the suspension of the animal life, not
a single particle of air will be discovered in the veins.</p>

<p>In these experiments which I have frequently repeated,
I have never found that the least fissure has been made in
the bronchiæ; nevertheless, I confess that it is difficult to
say, whether this be so in their last ramifications. The
following phenomenon, however, may throw some light
upon the subject; for as often as air is pushed into the
lungs with great violence, there will be produced an
emphysema of the breast, or neck, from the infiltration
of this fluid among the cellular texture, in addition to its
passage into the blood. But if the impulse be moderate,
and the quantity of air injected not much beyond the
measure of a full inspiration, it will pass into the blood
only, and not into the cellular texture.<a name="FNanchor_107_107" id="FNanchor_107_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[288]</a></span></p>

<p>The experiments of which I have given the detail, exemplify
phenomena which do not indeed take place in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[289]</a></span>
ordinary process of inspiration, and therefore I allow that
no very rigorous induction can be drawn from them, with
respect to the passage of deleterious substances into the
mass of the blood; nevertheless it appears to me, that
they very much confirm the probability of such fact,
which besides is demonstrated by many of the preceding
remarks. I shall conclude, then, that such passage is real.
In fact, we have seen 1st, That the sole transmission of
the black blood into the arteries, will not account for the
infinitely various phenomena exemplified in the different
sorts of asphyxiæ; 2dly, That the simple contact of the
deleterious substance with the nerves of the lungs, can by
no means be the cause of a death so rapid as that which
is occasioned by these accidents; 3dly, That, therefore,
we are forced as it were to suspect the passage of the
poison itself into the blood; 4thly, That a number of
considerations are in favour of such suspicion, and thus
that the fact is proved both directly and indirectly.<a name="FNanchor_109_109" id="FNanchor_109_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a></p>

<p>This principle being once established, a variety of
results must flow from it. Of the first of these, of the
mode of action, namely, which the deleterious substance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[290]</a></span>
must exercise upon the different organs, I shall say
nothing, having nothing to offer but conjecture.</p>

<p>I shall accordingly content myself with inquiring what
system it is which is particularly influenced by these
substances, when mingled with the blood.&mdash;Now, 1st,
This system appears to be the nervous one, and that
portion of it especially, which presides over the parts of
the animal life, the organic functions being only secondarily
affected; 2dly, Of all the nervous system, the brain
is that part which is the most affected; 3dly, Under this
relation Monsieur Pinel appears to me to have been right,
in placing some of the asphyxiæ (those for instance which
are occasioned by the presence of a deleterious substance)
among the neuroses. On this head the following considerations
should leave us little doubt.</p>

<p>1st, In all the asphyxiæ, when the presence of a deleterious
substance cannot be doubted, the symptoms consist
of two general and opposite sets of phenomena, of spasm
and torpor. Of two workmen who had come up out of
the sewer of the street St. André des Ares, the one
sat himself down upon a bulk, and fell into a state of
asphyxia; the other with irregular convulsive movements,
proceeded as far as the rue Battoir, and then fell down
asphyxiated. The Sieur Verville, in consequence of
inhaling the breath of a man who was lying in a state
of asphyxia from the vapour of lead, fell down suddenly,
and in a short time became convulsed. The vapour of
charcoal intoxicates, as it is said. I have seen animals
asphyxiated with other gases, and perishing with a stiffness,
such as could be produced only by the most violent
spasm. The centre of all these symptoms, and the organ
from which they emanate, undoubtedly is the brain, and
they depend upon its irritation or compression.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[291]</a></span></p>

<p>2dly, The animal life is always interrupted before the
organic life, wherever the asphyxiating cause has been of
a compound nature. Now the centre of the animal life
is the brain.</p>

<p>3dly, I have proved when the animal perishes from
the circulation of the black blood in the arteries, that the
brain is especially affected even then; but in the same
way, that is, by the cephalic arteries, the deleterious substance
itself, may be introduced into the brain.</p>

<p>4thly, I have pushed a variety of deleterious gases (for
example, sulphurated hydrogen) into the brain, and also
some of those substances which vitiate the nature of these
gases. The animal has always perished with symptoms
of spasm, or torpor, and in general the death which is
occasioned by the different gases, is always similar to that
which is produced by the introduction of pernicious substances
into the brain.</p>

<p>5thly, The consequences of these asphyxiæ, when life
has been restored, invariably suppose a lesion of the
cerebral system, such consequences consist of palsy, tremour,
wandering pains, and derangements of the exterior
apparatus of the senses.</p>

<p>From all these multiform experiments and considerations,
we may surely conclude, that it is on the brain and
nervous system that the deleterious principle, introduced
into the blood, must act; from the death of these parts,
that of the others is derived.</p>

<p>In this case the different organs no doubt are directly
enfeebled, and may perhaps be immediately affected by
those principles, which flow into them together with the
blood, but all such phenomena, are even more visible in
the animal, than in the organic life.</p>

<p>Let us not forget however, that a part at least of the
cause of this sort of death, consists in the influence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[292]</a></span>
venous blood upon the organs, and that this influence
must ever be in proportion to the length of time that
such blood continues to circulate. The differences then
which are found in the asphyxiæ, may be said to proceed
from the greater or less effect of the venous blood upon
the system, from the different nature of the various
deleterious substances inspired, and from the age and
temperament of the individual affected.</p>


<h4>II. <em>In the greater number of diseases, death commences
in the lungs.</em></h4>

<p>I have just spoken of sudden death. I shall now
enlarge a little on that which is the slow effect of disease.
Physicians must be well persuaded, that by far the greater
number of diseases, put an end to life by an affection of
the lungs. Whatever be the seat of the principal affection,
be it either an organic lesion, or a general disorder
of the system, the action of the lungs in the latter
moments of existence, becomes embarrassed, the respiration
difficult, and the oxydation of the blood, but slowly
effected; accordingly this fluid must pass into the arteries,
almost in the venous state.</p>

<p>The organs therefore which are already enfeebled, must
be much more readily affected by the pernicious influence
of such blood, than those which are subject to it, in the
different cases of asphyxia. In this way the loss of
sensation, and intellect, are very shortly the effect of
embarrassment in the lungs; and ensue as soon as the
brain begins to be penetrated with the fluid which is so
transmitted to it.</p>

<p>By degrees the heart and all the organs of the internal
life, cease also to move. It is here the black blood
which arrests these vital motions, which have already<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[293]</a></span>
been enfeebled by the disease. Such weakness, the consequences
of the disease, is very rarely the immediate
cause of death, it only prepares it, by rendering the
organs more susceptible of the alteration in the healthy
state of the blood. Such alteration is almost always the
immediate cause of death. The disease then, is only an
indirect cause of death in general, it kills the lungs, and
the death of the lungs occasions that of all the other
parts.</p>

<p>From hence it may be easily conceived, why the small
quantity of blood contained in the arterial system of the
subject, is almost always black. For 1st, The greater
number of deaths begin by the lungs. 2dly, We shall
see that those which have their commencement in the
brain, are equally the cause of this phenomenon. Accordingly
there can be only those, in which the heart ceases
suddenly to act, after which the red blood can be found
in the aortic ventricle, and auricle. Such appearance is
seldom found, excepting in the bodies of persons who
have perished from extensive hemorrhagy.</p>

<p>From the frequency of deaths beginning with an embarrassment
of the lungs, may be conceived also the reason,
why this organ is so frequently gorged with blood in the
carcase in general, the longer the agony, the heavier
and fuller are the lungs. When such fulness is found,
together with black blood in the red-blooded system,
whatever the disease may have been, it may be pronounced
that death has begun in the lungs. In fact the concatenation
of the phenomena of death is from one of the
three organs, from the lungs, brain, or heart, to all the
others. Now when death begins in the heart, the pulmonary
vessels are generally empty, and there is red blood
in the aortic system. On the other hand, if death has
begun in the brain, there is then indeed a certain quantity<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">[294]</a></span>
of blood in the arteries, but the lungs are empty, unless,
when gorged with blood, by some antecedent affection.</p>

The intercostal muscles are, in this case, the sole agents of respiration,
which becomes nearly analogous to that of birds or to that of

<p><a name="Footnote_101_101" id="Footnote_101_101"></a><a href="#FNanchor_101_101"><span class="label">[101]</span></a> When from any cause, the diaphragm cannot contract, the enlargement
of the thorax is effected solely by the elevation of the ribs, and
as this motion is then very evident, we can then appreciate better
the influence the intercostal muscles have in its production in ordinary
respiration. Haller, as is well known, supposed that the first rib was
almost immoveable, and that the muscles in the first intercostal space,
took it as their fixed point to elevate the second. This second rib, in
its turn, served as a fixed point to elevate the third, and thus on to the
last rib. But if we observe the mechanical phenomena of respiration
when the diaphragm does not contract, as is the case in diaphragmatic
pleurisy, we see that the first rib is far from being immoveable. Now,
we cannot conceive how the intercostals which are attached to its
inferior part, can, by contracting, assist in raising it. Besides, in order
to elevate the ribs, a very great resistance must be overcome, and the
intercostal muscles are too slender to induce us to suppose that they
are capable of effecting it. The principal agents of this motion then
are the anterior and posterior scaleni, which are distinctly seen to contract
in great inspirations, the supra-costales and the muscles of the
neck which attach it to the sternum. We ought to add to these a
muscle, to which this use has never before been attributed; I mean the
diaphragm. This muscle in fact in its contraction tends to become flat,
from being concave as it is in inspiration. Now, its middle part in
depressing the abdominal viscera experiences a certain resistance, and
takes, as it were, from them a fixed point, by means of which it elevates
the base of the thorax to which its circumference is attached.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_103_103" id="Footnote_103_103"></a><a href="#FNanchor_103_103"><span class="label">[103]</span></a> By injecting into the veins different irrespirable gases, Nysten has
been able to distinguish the effects which result from the deleterious
properties of the gases from those which arise from the alteration of
respiration from a want of atmospheric air.
</p>
<p>
Thus among the elastic fluids which he tried, he found sulphuretted
hydrogen, the deutoxide of azote, chlorine and ammoniacal gas eminently
deleterious; for introduced in sufficient quantity into the animal
economy they uniformly cause death, whilst others, such as oxygen,
azote, hydrogen, carburetted hydrogen, carbonic acid, oxide of carbon,
and protoxide of azote do not produce death when introduced into the
lungs, except by excluding the only mixture, that can support respiration;
in no other way do they occasion death, at least in a sudden manner.
If however, they are thrown quickly into the blood vessels, they cause
death, but it is mechanically and in the same way as atmospheric air
would do it. It should also be observed that these different gases do
not all act in the same way when they are introduced into the lungs;
the gaseous oxide of carbon destroys animals much quicker than azote
or the protoxide of azote. They die also quicker in the proto-phosphuretted
hydrogen, and even in the carbonic acid gas. There are also in
the action of deleterious gases certain anomalies which have not hitherto
been explained. Nysten injected, at three injections, into the veins of
a dog of middle size thirty centimetres of sulphuretted hydrogen. The
animal after the first injection, was agitated, and made powerful inspirations;
the second produced convulsive motions and the third apparent
death; but the next day he was entirely well. Now a less quantity of
sulphuretted hydrogen carried into the organs of respiration and mixed
with five or six hundred times its volume of air, would infallibly destroy
the animal.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_104_104" id="Footnote_104_104"></a><a href="#FNanchor_104_104"><span class="label">[104]</span></a> The composition of some of these vapours is better known at the
present day; but there are others in which our means of analysis have
been unable to detect the deleterious principle; thus in the <em>malaria</em>,
which has depopulated the country in the neighbourhood of Rome, our
chemists have as yet only found as constant elements, those which enter
into the composition of atmospheric air.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_105_105" id="Footnote_105_105"></a><a href="#FNanchor_105_105"><span class="label">[105]</span></a> It appears from the experiments of M. Desormes that the contact
of sulphuretted hydrogen on the skin of an animal is immediately fatal.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_106_106" id="Footnote_106_106"></a><a href="#FNanchor_106_106"><span class="label">[106]</span></a> We know that fine injections pass from the branches of the pulmonary
artery into the divisions of the bronchia; and that even water,
when pushed into the trachea, will return, at least a small quantity of
it, by the pulmonary veins and arteries.
</p>
<p>
Bichat thought that the gases absorbed in the lungs must pass through
the mucous membrane; but this is not the case unless absorption takes
place at the time they are in the bronchia, for the mucous membrane
which lines the air-tubes does not extend into each bronchial lobule.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_107_107" id="Footnote_107_107"></a><a href="#FNanchor_107_107"><span class="label">[107]</span></a> This fact, frequently confirmed in my experiments, is not always the
same in man. We often see emphysema produced by violent efforts of
respiration, efforts which have forced into the cellular organ the air
contained in the lungs. Now, if the passage of the air in the blood
preceded or even accompanied its introduction into the neighbouring
cells of the bronchia, all these cases of emphysema would be necessarily
fatal, and even in a sudden manner, since, from what has been said
before, the contact of the air on the brain, to which the circulation
would carry it, would inevitably interrupt the functions of this organ.
</p>
<p>
Yet we see that emphysema is often cured, or does not produce death
for a length of time.<a name="FNanchor_108_108" id="FNanchor_108_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> I saw, at the Hotel Dieu, an air tumour, suddenly
appear in the axilla, from the violent efforts of the patient to prevent
respiration, whilst Desault reduced an old luxation. In a few days this
tumour disappeared without producing any inconvenience. We find,
in the Memoirs of the Academy of Surgery and in Treatises on Operations,
various examples of emphysema produced by powerful agitations
of the thorax, and in consequence of the introduction of a foreign body
into the wind-pipe; emphysema, with which the patients have lived
many days, and from which even they have recovered.
</p>
<p>
There is then no doubt, that often in man the air passes from the
lungs into the cellular texture, without entering the arterial system.
My experiments on animals have not been exactly analogous to what
happens from the introduction of a foreign body, when a part of the
air enters and goes out. It is then probable that from a cause precisely
similar would arise also the same effect in animals.
</p>
<p>
And vice versa, the passage of the air in the blood-vessels sometimes
takes place in man, without the infiltration of the cellular organ; then
the death is sudden.
</p>
<p>
A fisherman, subject to colick, was suddenly seized with it in his
boat; the abdomen swelled, the respiration became painful and the
patient died almost instantaneously. Morgagni opened the body the
next day, and found the vessels full of air. Pechlin also says he saw a
man die suddenly in great distress and with a hurried respiration, and
he afterwards found a large quantity of air in the heart and in the large
vessels.
</p>
<p>
I have dissected many bodies, in which, before death there had been
a sanguineous congestion in the exterior capillary system of the face,
the neck and even of the thorax. This system exhibited a remarkable
engorgement and lividity in all its parts, and I have found in opening
the arteries and veins, in those of the neck and head especially, a
frothy blood, mixed with bubbles of air. I learnt that one of these
subjects died suddenly with a convulsive affection of the pectoral
muscles; I have no information respecting the others. Besides, all
who have had much to do with dissecting rooms, must have seen bodies
of this kind, which very soon become putrid and emit an insupportable
odour. They have observed also that the air in the vessels existed
previous to the putrefaction.
</p>
<p>
I suspect that in all these cases death has been produced by the
sudden passage of air from the lungs into the blood, which has afterwards
carried it to the brain; nearly like what I have said takes place,
when, in a living animal, we force much air towards the lungs, and thus
drive this fluid into the vascular system.
</p>
<p>
By considering these phenomena in connexion with the remarks
presented above on death from the injection of air into the veins, the
opinion I have advanced, will I think, be admitted, and it is besides the
opinion of many other physicians. Many experiments have already
been made on the dead body relative to this point. Morgagni has
presented them in detail; but it is on the living that we must observe
the passage of the air into the blood in order to deduce consequences
which shall bear on the subject on which we are treating. We know
in fact what is the influence of death on the permeability of the parts.</p></div>

of the neck was so considerable, that at the moment I was called
suffocation was imminent. I made, in the skin above the sternum, an
opening, which very quickly produced an evacuation of the air. In
five or six days, though the hooping cough continued, this little patient
was entirely cured of the emphysema, which had been very near
destroying her. It did not appear to me that the lungs had participated
at all in the general emphysema.</p></div>

<br />
<span class="fs50">OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE DEATH OF THE BRAIN OVER
THAT OF THE LUNGS.</span></h3>


<p>As soon as the human brain ceases to act, the functions
of the lungs are suddenly interrupted; this phenomenon,
which is constantly observed in the red and warm-blooded
animals, can happen only in two ways. 1st, Because
the action of the brain, is directly necessary to that of
the lungs, or 2dly, Because the latter receives from the
former, an indirect influence by means of the intercostal
muscles and diaphragm, an influence, which ceases with
the activity of the cerebral mass. Let us try to determine
which of these two modes is that of nature.</p>


<h4>I. <em>Is it directly that the lungs cease to act upon the
death of the brain?</em></h4>

<p>I shall have proved that the death of the brain, is not
immediately the occasion of that of the lungs, if I can
determine that there is no immediate influence exercised
by the first, upon the second of these organs, now, this
essential principle may be easily demonstrated by experiment.</p>

<p>The brain can exercise an immediate influence on the
lungs, only by means of the par vagum or the great
sympathetic nerve, the only nerves, which according to
the common opinion, establish a communication between<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[295]</a></span>
the two organs (an opinion however which is erroneous,
as the great sympathetic is only an agent of communication
between the organs and the ganglions of the system.)
Now 1st, The influence which is derived by the lungs
from the par vagum, is not actually necessary for them
to act. The following experiments will show the truth
of this assertion.</p>

<p>1st, Irritate the par vagum on one or both sides, and
the respiration of the animal will be somewhat quickened;
but such appearance is no proof of an immediate influence,
for any wound of the neck, or any wound whatever,
provided that it be the occasion of considerable pain, will
be the cause of a similar phenomenon.</p>

<p>2dly, Cut one of the nerves, and the respiration will
be at once affected, as when the nerve is irritated; but
as soon as the pain ceases, the embarrassment of the lungs
will disappear; and at the end of four and twenty hours,
the phenomena of life be concatenated with their accustomed
regularity.</p>

<p>3dly, Divide these nerves on both sides. In this case
the breathing will be much more precipitated, and will
not return to its ordinary state, as in the preceding experiment;
it continues laborious for four or five days, and

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[296]</a></span></p>
<p>From the two latter experiments it follows, that the
par vagum is indeed necessary to the phenomena of
respiration, and that the brain must exercise, of course,
an influence over this function, but at the same time, it
may be seen, that without the immediate influence of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[297]</a></span>
brain, the lungs will continue in play, and consequently
that the interruption of such influence, as when the brain
is injured, will not be an immediate obstacle to the continuation
of the pulmonary actions.</p>

<p>The question whether the functions of the lungs are
more immediately connected with the influence derived
from the ganglions, may be decided by the following
facts.</p>

<p>1st, If on the one and the other side of the neck, the
nervous thread be cut, which is usually regarded as the
trunk of the great sympathetic, there follows little or no
alteration in the phenomena of respiration.</p>

<p>2dly, If the par vagum and the great sympathetic be
divided at the same time on both sides of the neck, the
animal will die after a certain time, and much in the same
way, as when only the par vagum is divided.</p>

<p>3dly, When we divide the sympathetic nerve in the
neck, we do not deprive the lungs of the nerves which
come from the first thoracic ganglion; now these nerves
may contribute to keep up the action of the lungs, since,
as I have said, each ganglion is a nervous centre, capable
of emitting its own peculiar irradiations, independently of
the other centres, with which it communicates.</p>

<p>But whether the nerves, which are derived from the
first thoracic ganglion, do really assist the functions of
the lungs, I have not been able to ascertain by experiments
on the nerves themselves, for such is the position
of the first thoracic ganglion in most animals, that it
cannot be taken away without doing so much injury to
the parts as would kill the creature, or throw it into such
agitation, as wholly to confound the phenomena of which
we are in search, with those of a general distress and
trouble. From analogy, however, and from the destruction
of other ganglions, by which the internal organs are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">[298]</a></span>
supplied, we should not have a right to suppose that the
lungs would cease to act, when the ganglion in question
is destroyed.</p>

<p>Besides, the following reasons appear to me to prove
unquestionably, the principle which I advance. If great
lesions of the brain have the effect of suddenly interrupting
respiration, because this organ can no longer influence
the lungs by means of the nerves, which come from the
first thoracic ganglion, it is evident that if all communication
between the brain and this ganglion be taken away,
such influence must cease, and respiration be suspended;
but if we divide, as Cruikshanks has done, the spinal marrow
on a level with the last of the cervical vertebræ, the
animal will continue to live and breathe for a length of
time, notwithstanding the want of communication between
the brain and the lungs, by means of the first thoracic
ganglion. From the above experiments, we may conclude,
that the brain does not exercise any direct and
actual influence over the lungs, and consequently that
other causes must be sought for, if we mean to account
for that sudden and instantaneous cessation of the functions
of the latter of these organs, when those of the
former are suspended.</p>

<p>There exists, notwithstanding, a phenomenon which
seems to cast some doubt upon the conclusion which I
have deduced, and in the principle which it establishes.
I speak of the sudden difficulty of respiration, and that
impeded circulation which are occasioned by violent pain.
This distress appears to indicate that the heart and the
lungs are dependent immediately upon the brain; for the
distress is in the brain, say the greater number of authors,
and the affection of the heart and lungs, a consequence of
the reaction of the brain; but here let it be remembered,
that almost all pain is made up, first of sensation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">[299]</a></span>
secondly of some <em>emotion</em>, <em>passion</em> or <em>affection</em>.<a name="FNanchor_111_111" id="FNanchor_111_111"></a><a href="#Footnote_111_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> Now
as I have proved at length, in the former part of this
work, all passion and emotion have their seat in the internal
viscera, and thus it will appear, that the trouble which
in such case is felt in the heart and lungs, does not depend
upon the brain for its cause, but is the immediate effect
of the passion, or emotion, which accompanies the sensation.
The following considerations will bear me out in
this conclusion.</p>

<p>1st, In many instances the dyspnœa and impeded circulation,
precede the pain. Examine the thorax, and place
your hand upon the heart of a man about to undergo an
operation, and you will be easily convinced of this truth.</p>

<p>2dly, There is sometimes a manifest disproportion between
the sensation of pain, and the distress which is
experienced about the heart, and in breathing. I have
known the operation of cutting away the prepuce immediately
fatal. Now in this case, it surely could not be
pain which killed the man.</p>

<p>3dly, There are many persons who are capable of supporting
violent pain, with resolution. Place your hand
upon the heart of such persons, and no agitation whatever
will be felt there. Nevertheless, their perception of pain
must be what it is in other persons.</p>

<p>4thly, In the course of an operation, we are not to
judge of the patient’s state of mind, from his cries, or
silence. This sign is very deceitful; because a man may
be sufficiently master of himself to overpower the influence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[300]</a></span>
of his internal organs. We must examine the heart
and lungs; their functions, if I may allow myself the
expression, are the thermometer of the affections of the
mind. It is not without reason, that the actor who plays
the part of a courageous man, takes hold upon the hand
of him whom he wishes to set at ease, and lays it on his
heart. The exterior movements of the passions, are not a
fair criterion of the inward feelings of the individual, for
these movements may be feigned as well as real: feigned
if they originate in the brain: real if they have their
sources in the heart;&mdash;in the first case voluntary, in the
second involuntary. Touch the pulse of the angry man,
if you wish to know whether he really is in anger.
When I see a woman weeping or convulsed at any distressing
news, and find her pulse in its natural state, I
know what to judge of her affliction.&mdash;On the contrary,
if her grief be concentrated, but her heart beat strongly,
or her pulse have been suddenly depressed, I know that
she feigns a calm which she does not feel. To judge
correctly, we must always compare the external movement
with the state of the internal organs. There could
be no deceit, were it possible to distinguish the involuntary
movements produced in a state of passion, by the
action of the heart upon the brain, and then by the reaction
of the brain upon the muscles, from the voluntary
movements which are occasioned by the simple action of
the brain upon the locomotive system.</p>

<p>However strong may be the pain which has been the
occasion of the dyspnœa, and impeded circulation, of
which we have been speaking, this dyspnœa and distress
about the precordia, will cease, provided only that the
pain be continued. Nevertheless, if the reaction of the
brain were the real cause of the distress in question,
the contrary should be the case; for the continuation of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[301]</a></span>
the affection of the brain, should continue also to cause
its re-action. But here the effect of habit is evident,
though the pain subsists; the brain indeed continues to
be affected, but the internal organs cease to be so. It
may be easily perceived, that I am not here speaking of
those cases, where the action of the heart and lungs has
been deeply troubled by the effect of pain.</p>

<p>To the above considerations I might add many others,
with the view of proving, 1st, That although the brain
be the seat of the pain, it is not the source of those affections
of the internal organs, which are occasioned by
such pain; 2dly, That these affections depend upon an
emotion, which is absolutely distinct from sensation of
whatever kind, both in its nature and effects.</p>


<h4>II. <em>Is it indirectly that the lungs cease to act upon the
death of the brain?</em></h4>

<p>Since the death of the lungs, upon the cessation of the
cerebral action, is not direct, there must exist between
the brain and the lungs, some intermediate agents, the
cessation of whose functions, occasion the cessation of
those of the lungs. These agents are the diaphragm, and
intercostal muscles; for they depend immediately upon
the brain by means of the nerves, which they receive from
it, and consequently become paralytic on the death of the
brain; the following experiments are a proof of the fact.<a name="FNanchor_112_112" id="FNanchor_112_112"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[302]</a></span></p>

<p>1st, Cruikshanks divided the spinal marrow of a dog
between the last cervical, and the first dorsal vertebræ.
The intercostal muscles accordingly were immediately
paralyzed, and the breathing of the animal continued to
be made by the diaphragm only, which receives the
phrenic nerve from a point above the section. In this
experiment, it is easy to judge of the strong action of the
diaphragm, by that of the abdominal muscles.</p>

<p>2dly, If the phrenic nerves only be divided, the diaphragm
becomes immoveable, and then the respiration of
the animal is effected by the intercostal muscles only.</p>

<p>3dly, After the two preceding experiments, the animal
will live for a considerable time, but if the phrenic nerves,
and the spinal marrow, towards the end of the neck, be
divided at the same time, or what comes to the same
thing, if the spinal marrow be cut above the origin of the
phrenic nerves, then all communication between the brain
and the active agents of respiration is cut off, and death
follows of course.</p>

<p>4thly, I have frequently observed, that half an inch of
difference in the place where the spinal marrow is divided,
produces such a difference in its consequences, that in the
one case the death is sudden, and supervenes in the other
only, after an interval of fifteen or twenty hours. In
dissecting the carcases of animals killed in this manner,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[303]</a></span>
I have constantly observed that the difference depended
always upon the circumstance, of the phrenic nerve being
cut or not.</p>

<p>From these experiments then it is evident, that respiration
ceases on a sudden, and in the following manner, in
all lesions of that part of the nervous system, which is
placed above the origin of the phrenic nerves. 1st,
There is an interruption of action in the voluntary nerves,
which are placed below the point of lesion, and consequently
in the phrenic and intercostal nerves. 2dly, A
paralysis of almost all the muscles of the animal life, and
particularly of the diaphragm and intercostal muscles.
3dly, A cessation of the mechanical phenomena of respiration.
4thly, A suspension of the chemical phenomena
of respiration. The interruption of all these movements,
is as rapid as their concatenation is prompt, in the natural
order.</p>

<p>It is thus that those persons perish, who experience any
great lesion of the spinal marrow, between the brain and
the origin of the phrenic nerves. Physicians have been
very much embarrassed, in fixing with precision the spot,
when a wound of the medulla ceases to be mortal; from
what I have advanced, the limit is easily assigned.<a name="FNanchor_113_113" id="FNanchor_113_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> From
the same causes, concussion, and compression of the brain,
are also fatal.</p>

<p>We should observe notwithstanding, that these different
causes of death, may act with various degrees of intensity.
If they act but feebly, they affect the intellectual functions
only, for these functions are always the first to be
altered, in all lesions of the brain however small. If the
lesion be greater, the affection extends to the muscles of
the limbs, and convulsion or palsy ensue. Lastly, if the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">[304]</a></span>
lesion be very great, the whole of the muscles of the
animal life, the intercostals and diaphragm, as well as
the others, are paralyzed, and death follows.</p>

<p>We now can reply to the question proposed at the
beginning of this section, and affirm that the death of
the lungs is occasioned indirectly, by the death of the
brain.</p>

<p>It follows also, from the principles which are above
established, that respiration is a mixed function, a function
placed as it were between the two lives, to which it
serves as a point of contact, belonging to the animal life
by its mechanical functions, and to the organic life, by its
chemical functions; and hence we have the reason no
doubt, why the existence of the lungs is as much connected
with that of the brain, as with that of the heart.</p>

<p>It may be observed in the series of animals, that in
proportion as the organization of the brain is straitened,
a number of the phenomena of respiration also are lost.
In birds, and the mammalia, this function as well as the
brain, is much more developed than it is in the classes of
fish and reptiles. It is known, that the nervous system
of those animals which breathe by tracheæ, is less perfect
than in those which breathe by lungs; and that in those,
where there is no nervous system, that of respiration
disappears also.</p>

<p>In general, there is a reciprocal relation between the
brain and the lungs, especially in birds and the mammalia.
The first of these occasions the action of the second, by
raising the ribs and favouring the entrance of air into the
bronchiæ; the second also keeps up the activity of the
first, by means of the red blood which it sends thither.</p>

<p>It would be an interesting speculation to inquire into
the relation of the nervous system with that of respiration
in the class of insects, for as they receive the air<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">[305]</a></span>
by points, which open externally, there seems to be no
mechanical action in the process of their breathing, and
thus the function appears with them to belong entirely to
the organic life.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_110_110" id="Footnote_110_110"></a><a href="#FNanchor_110_110"><span class="label">[110]</span></a> The division of the nerves of the eighth pair in the neck produces
two kinds of effects, which should be carefully distinguished; the one
relates to the larynx and the other to the lungs. Among the first,
aphonia is one of the most striking symptoms. We see a very good
reason for this phenomenon, when we recollect that the recurrent nerve
is a branch of the eighth pair; but besides the loss of voice, the division
of the eighth pair often produces such an approximation of the edges of
the glottis that the air cannot enter, and death immediately takes
place.
</p>
<p>
Most usually, the approximation is not sufficient to prevent entirely
the entrance of the air into the thorax; but as the glottis has lost its
motions in relation with those of respiration, this function is always
performed in a more or less incomplete manner.
</p>
<p>
When these observations were first made, it was hardly possible to
give an accurate explanation of them; but since I have ascertained the
manner in which the recurrent and laryngeal nerves are distributed to
the muscles of the larynx, there is no longer any difficulty. By the
division of the eighth pair at the inferior part of the neck, the dilator
muscles of the glottis are paralyzed; this opening does not enlarge at
the moment of inspiration, whilst the constrictors, which receive their
nerves from the superior laryngeal, preserve their action entire, and shut
more or less completely the glottis.
</p>
<p>
When the division of the eighth pair does not close the glottis so
completely as to produce death immediately, another order of phenomena
is developed.
</p>
<p>
The respiration is at first embarrassed, and its rhythm often experiences
a remarkable alteration; the inspiration is slow, and the expiration
quick and short. The animal is averse to motion and seems to be easily
fatigued. At first the formation of the arterial blood is not prevented,
but soon its vermilion colour changes, it becomes darker and approximates
more and more that of the venous blood. The temperature falls,
and the very embarrassed respiration is only made by the aid of all the
muscular powers; the coldness becomes evident, and the animal soon
dies.
</p>
<p>
As this series of circumstances is developing, the animals, on whom
the experiments are made, consume less oxygen, and form less carbonic
acid.
</p>
<p>
We find, on opening the body, the bronchia filled with a frothy, and
sometimes a bloody fluid; the lungs are engorged, and the divisions of
the pulmonary artery are much distended with very black blood.
</p>
<p>
From all that has now been stated, it is natural to conclude that, in
this last case, the animals die because respiration can no longer be
effected, the lungs being so altered that the air cannot get into the
bronchial cells. To this cause should be added also the difficulty which
the blood experiences in passing from the arteries to the pulmonary
veins.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_111_111" id="Footnote_111_111"></a><a href="#FNanchor_111_111"><span class="label">[111]</span></a> These words <em>passion</em>, <em>emotion</em>, <em>affection</em>, &amp;c. have, I know, real
differences in the language of metaphysicians; but as the general effect

secondary phenomena are of no importance, I use these words indifferently
for each other.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_112_112" id="Footnote_112_112"></a><a href="#FNanchor_112_112"><span class="label">[112]</span></a> We have said in a preceding note, that the division of the nerves
of the eighth pair could produce death in two ways; first, by closing
the glottis, and preventing the entrance of the air into the air tubes;
secondly, by altering the lungs and preventing the production of the
chemical phenomena. Of these two kinds of death the first is in some
measure accidental; it is an indirect effect of the interruption of the
action of the brain; but it is not so with the second, and though it may
not be instantaneous, it is not less a direct effect of the division. It
might be supposed that the motions of the glottis being destroyed, and
the entrance of the air being rendered consequently more difficult, that
it is in consequence of this obstruction that respiration is embarrassed,
and that the alteration of the lungs is only a consecutive phenomenon.
But in the experiments made by M. Dupuy at Alfort, a free passage was
given to the air, by an opening made in the trachea. Now it cannot
be believed that the small wound necessary for this opening, could
contribute to produce the disturbance of the respiration, for a similar
operation is daily performed on horses, without producing the slightest
inconvenience.</p></div>

<h3><a name="P2_CHAPTER_XI" id="P2_CHAPTER_XI"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER XI.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="fs50">OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE DEATH OF THE BRAIN OVER
THAT OF THE HEART.</span></h3>


<p>In the preceding chapter we have shewn how the lungs
remain inactive, when the brain ceases to act.&mdash;The same
phenomenon, under the same circumstances, takes place
also in the heart, and must happen either immediately or
mediately.</p>


<h4>I. <em>Does the Heart cease to act immediately in consequence
of the interruption of the cerebral action?</em></h4>

<p>The greater number of medical men, speak in much
too vague a manner of the cerebral influence. They
do not sufficiently determine its extent and limits, with
respect to the different organs of the system.</p>

<p>It is evident that we shall have answered the question
proposed at the head of this section, if we can determine
what the influence of the brain is with regard to the heart.
Now, we have every reason to suppose, that no direct
influence is exercised by the former over the latter of
these organs, which, on the contrary, is immediately
dependent with regard to its operations, on the movement
communicated to it by the blood. This assertion is by
no means a new one. It has been admitted by all sound<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">[306]</a></span>
physiologists; but as many opinions in medicine are
founded upon a contrary principle, it will not be amiss to
dwell upon it a little. It is equally demonstrated both
by observation and experiment&mdash;and to begin with the
former:</p>

<p>1st, All violent irritation made upon the brain, produces
either partial, or general convulsion in the muscles
of the animal life. Examine those of the organic life,
on the contrary, and little will be found amiss in their
actions.</p>

<p>2dly, All compression of the cerebral mass, whether
made by pus, water or blood, has ordinarily the effect of
paralyzing the voluntary muscles; but so long as the
affection does not extend to the muscles of the breast, the
action of the heart is in no degree diminished.</p>

<p>3dly, Opium and wine, when taken in a certain quantity,
diminish the cerebral energy for the moment and
render the brain unfit for the functions of the animal life.
The action of the heart, on the contrary, is increased.</p>

<p>4thly, In palpitation, and the different irregular movements
of the heart, it is not observable that the principle
of these derangements exists in the brain.&mdash;In this respect,
as well as on the subject of syncope, Cullen has been
mistaken. The brain during such time, continues in
action as usual.</p>

<p>5thly, The numerous phenomena of apoplexy, and
epilepsy, and concussion, &amp;c. do certainly all of them tend
to shew, how independent the heart is of the brain.</p>

<p>6thly, Every organ which is subject to the direct influence
of the brain, is for that very reason an organ of
volition. Now, I should suppose, that few persons of the
present day, would be inclined to maintain with Stahl,
that the heart is among the number of such organs.
What would life be, were we able at will, to suspend the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_307" id="Page_307">[307]</a></span>
action of the organ, by which the system is animated?
From simple observation, then, we might conclude, that
it is not immediately that the heart ceases to act, when
the functions of the brain are interrupted, but this fundamental
datum of physiology and pathology, we shall
further establish, upon actual experiment.</p>

<p>1st, If the brain of an animal be exposed, and irritated
either with mechanical or chemical agents, a variety of
alterations will, indeed, be produced in the organs of the
animal life, but none in the heart, so long as the muscles
of the breast continue to perform their functions.</p>

<p>2dly, Experiments made in the same manner upon the
spinal marrow of the neck, present the same results.</p>

<p>3dly, If the eighth pair of nerves be irritated, the
movements of the heart will not be accelerated; they will
not be arrested if these two nerves be divided. In all
these experiments, however, we must be careful to make
a proper distinction between the emotions and passions
of the animal, and what it really suffers from the experiment.</p>

<p>4thly, The nature of the great sympathetic nerve, I
suppose to be known;<a name="FNanchor_114_114" id="FNanchor_114_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> now if the same experiments be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_308" id="Page_308">[308]</a></span>
made on the cardiac branches of this nerve, as were made
upon the eighth pair, the same results will follow.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_309" id="Page_309">[309]</a></span></p>

<p>I do not offer in detail the whole of these experiments;
the greater part of them are well known: I was induced
to repeat them, as authors are not agreed upon their consequences.</p>

<p>The experiments of galvanism, are well calculated to
throw light upon the relations existing between the heart
and the brain; these I have taken care to repeat with
the utmost exactness, and whatever authors may have
advanced, they are all in favour of the above opinions&mdash;for
1st, If the galvanic apparatus be applied to the brain,
and to the heart, and inferior extremities of a frog, and
the communication made between the metals, there will
constantly be seen a strong contraction in the muscles of
the limb, and little or none in the heart. The same will
be the case, to whatever voluntary muscle the zinc be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_310" id="Page_310">[310]</a></span>
applied. 2dly, The same results will be had, on the
communication being made between the metals applied
on the one hand to the spinal marrow above the giving
off of the sympathetic, and on the other hand to the heart,
and any of the voluntary muscles.</p>

<p>3dly, On establishing a communication between the
metals applied to the cardiac nerves, and to the heart of
the animal, there has been no contraction in the heart.
In all these essays, the natural disposition between the
parts which serve to unite the two organs, is preserved:
there are other experiments which consist in detaching
the heart from the breast. 2dly, In placing two points of
its surface in contact with two different metals. 3dly, In
making the communication between them with a third.
From this experiment, Humboldt and other philosophers
have procured contractions, but I have taken care to
repeat it with the greatest accuracy, and must assert,
that I have seen little or nothing of the kind; indeed,
if I had, I should have concluded nothing from it;
for it appears to me, that to decide upon the influence
of the brain over the heart, a portion at least of the
nervous system, should be in contact with one of the
metals.</p>

<p>I shall now pass to my experiments on red and warm-blooded
animals. They are necessary for the decision of
the question before us, as the mode of contractility in
these animals differs much from that of the animals submitted
to the experiments already mentioned.</p>

<p>1st, In the winter of the year 1798, I was authorized
to make different essays on the bodies of persons who
had been guillotined. I had them at my disposal thirty
or forty minutes after they had undergone the punishment.
In some of them, all mobility was extinct; in others,
this property could be reanimated in all the muscles by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_311" id="Page_311">[311]</a></span>
the common agents, and in those of the animal life, by
galvanism especially.<a name="FNanchor_115_115" id="FNanchor_115_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> Notwithstanding which, I could
never occasion the least motion, in applying the apparatus<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[312]</a></span>
either to the spinal marrow and the heart, or to this
latter organ and the nerves, which it receives from the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[313]</a></span>
ganglions of the sympathetic, or the par vagum. Nevertheless,
the common mechanical excitant, immediately
applied to the fleshy fibre, occasioned its contraction.
Could this have happened in consequence of the separation
of the nervous fillets from the brain? assuredly not;
because the voluntary muscles were equally separated
from it, and yet affected strongly. If any doubt remain,
the following experiments will clear it up.</p>

<p>2dly, In dogs and guinea pigs, I have repeatedly applied
the metals, first to the brain and the heart, then to the
trunk of the spinal marrow, and the heart; then to the par
vagum and the heart. The communication being made,
was followed by no apparent result.</p>

<p>3dly, On making the communication between the
metals, when applied to the cardiac nerves and the heart,
there was no very sensible motion.</p>

<p>4thly, Humboldt has asserted, that when the heart is
speedily detached with some of its nervous threads about
it, a contraction may be excited, by arming the nerves
with a metal, and then by touching this metal with another.
I have many times tried this experiment in vain. I confess,
however, that once it appeared to me to succeed.</p>

<p>5thly, On the contrary, I have almost always succeeded
in producing contractions in the heart, by cutting
it away from the breast, and making a communication
between a couple of metals, applied to different points of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_314" id="Page_314">[314]</a></span>
its surface. This, if I am not mistaken, is the only means
of evidently producing the phenomena of galvanism in
this organ, but with respect to our present question, the
experiment is wholly inconclusive.</p>

<p>All these experiments I have repeated many times, and
with the most scrupulous precautions, nevertheless I do
not pretend to call in question the reality of those results,
which other physicians have remarked. It is well known
how very variable those experiments are, which have the
vital powers for their object. Besides, in admitting even
these different results, I do not see how it is possible to
refuse acknowledging, that with respect to the stimulus
of galvanism, there is a wide difference between the
susceptibility of the muscles of the animal life, and those
of the organic life. Again, supposing that the galvanic
phenomena were the same in both sorts of muscles, the
fact would prove nothing more, than that these phenomena
with regard to their succession, follow laws directly the
contrary of those, which are displayed in the phenomena
which take place, when any common cause of irritation
is applied to the nerves and their corresponding muscles.</p>

<p>The proofs adduced, will allow us to conclude, that the
brain exercises no direct influence over the heart, and
consequently, that when it ceases to act, the functions of
the latter must be interrupted indirectly.</p>


<h4>II. <em>In case of lesion of the brain, is the death of the
heart occasioned by that of any intermediate organ?</em></h4>

<p>When the brain dies, the heart dies, but not directly.
There must be some intermediate organ then, the death
of which occasions that of the heart.<a name="FNanchor_116_116" id="FNanchor_116_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> That intermediate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[315]</a></span>
organ is the lungs. In this sort of death, the following
is the series of the phenomena which may be observed.</p>

<p>1st, The cerebral action is interrupted. 2dly, The
action of all the muscles of the animal life, and consequently
of the intercostals and diaphragm, is annihilated.
3dly, The mechanical functions of the lungs are suspended.
4thly, The like ensues with respect to their chemical
functions. 5thly, The fibres of the heart are penetrated
with black blood. 6thly, The fibres when so penetrated,
die.</p>

<p>Such sort of death then, has much resemblance with that
which is occasioned by the different asphyxiæ. It is only
more sudden, and that for reasons which I shall presently
point out. The following experiments are an evident<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[316]</a></span>
proof that the phenomena take place as I have described
them to do.</p>

<p>1st, I have always found black blood in the red-blooded
system of all animals, killed by concussion or compression
of the brain; the heart livid, and the different surfaces
coloured as in asphyxia.</p>

<p>2dly, I opened the carotid artery of a dog; the red
blood instantly gushed out, but was immediately suppressed,
and the artery tied. I then killed the creature, by
striking him with violence on the occipital bone.<a name="FNanchor_117_117" id="FNanchor_117_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> The
animal life, and consequently both the mechanical and
chemical functions of the lungs, were suddenly suppressed.
The artery was then united. It poured forth the black
blood with a feeble jet, for some little time, and after some
minutes, the heart entirely ceased to move.</p>

<p>3dly, I have always obtained a similar result in opening
the arteries of different animals which I afterwards
killed, either by dividing the marrow between the first
vertebra and occiput, or by strongly compressing the
brain, which I had previously exposed.&mdash;It is thus also
that animals perish, by the carotids of which a deleterious
substance has been injected.</p>

<p>4thly, The preceding experiments explain the reason
why the blood is black which flows from the arteries of
animals, which are bled in our slaughter-houses, after
having been knocked in the head. If the blow has been
violent, the blood issues such as it was in the veins, but
if the action of the diaphragm and intercostals has only
been weakened by the blow, the redness of the blood is
only diminished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[317]</a></span></p>

<p>The state in which the respiration may be (and it is
altered from a variety of circumstances during profuse
hemorrhagy) occasions a great variety in the colour of the
arterial blood: hence we have the reason why it is found
of so many different shades in the great operations of
surgery. At the beginning of these, it often flows out
quite red; at the end of them, is sometimes almost black.
The easy or embarrassed state of the respiration of the
patient, is the occasion of these varieties. This I have
frequently remarked, when attending Desault, and was
often struck with the appearance, before I knew the cause
of it.</p>

<p>I have never found any relation whatever, between the
obscure colour of the blood, and the compression exercised
above the artery, as some have asserted to take place.
There is, indeed, a connection between the colour and
the impetuosity of the jet, but the reason of this is evident
to any one who has read the foregoing pages.</p>

<p>To return to the point of doctrine on which we are at
present occupied, I am persuaded from the considerations
and experiments which are adduced in the course of this
chapter, that the manner in which the heart ceases to act,
when the cerebral functions are suspended, can no longer
admit of a doubt, and that we may resolve the question
proposed, in affirming that under such circumstances, the
death of the heart is occasioned through the medium of
that of the lungs.</p>

<p>There is this difference, then, between the death of the
heart, in consequence of that of the brain, and the death
of the brain in consequence of that of the heart, that the
one is indirect, the other direct, as we have already seen.
If some men, as Stahl asserts, have really been able to
suspend the movements of the heart, the fact is not a
proof of the influence of the mind over the muscles of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[318]</a></span>
organic life, but of its power over the mechanical, and
consequently, the chemical phenomena of respiration.</p>

<p>In red and cold-blooded animals, the death of the heart
does not succeed the death of the brain so quickly as it
does in red and warm-blooded animals. Cut off the head
of a frog, and the heart will continue to beat for some time
afterwards. This phenomenon will be easily accounted
for, if we recollect that respiration with these animals
may be suspended a length of time, without arresting the
movements of the heart.</p>

<p>In fact, as the heart dies only because the lungs die in
the first place, when the cerebral functions are interrupted,
it is plain that there ought to exist between the violent
death of the heart and that of the brain, an interval nearly
equal to that during which, in the natural state, there may
be a suspension of respiration.</p>


<div class="footnotes"><h3>FOOTNOTES:</h3>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_114_114" id="Footnote_114_114"></a><a href="#FNanchor_114_114"><span class="label">[114]</span></a> Physiologists have paid much attention to the great sympathetic
nerve. They have made, in relation to its uses, many conjectures but
few experiments; so that we have not on this subject any very precise
notions. The deep situation of the ganglions renders them almost
inaccessible, the superior cervical is almost the only one that can be
taken out without producing death. M. Dupuy, Professor of the
Veterinary School at Alfort, has discovered a method by which he can
remove them with ease. We shall now relate some of his observations.
</p>
<p>
“<em>1st Experiment.</em> The first experiment was made on a young and
vigorous horse, who had been treated for the glanders; it soon appeared
that he was not affected with it, and that it was merely the caries of a
tooth that had led to the belief of the existence of the disease.
</p>
<p>
“On the 24th of June his left guttural ganglion was extirpated.
Soon after the operation, the eye of that side appeared to be
more sunk in its socket, the eyelids were swelled and the pupil contracted.
</p>
<p>
“On the 28th of June the sub lingual ganglion appeared swollen,
hard and attached; a discharge of fetid, greyish matter was discovered
in the nostril of the same side.
</p>
<p>
“On the 29th of June, the wound suppurated copiously.
</p>
<p>
“From the 30th of June till the 16th of July the wound advanced
rapidly towards cicatrization.
</p>
<p>
“From the 18th of July to the 15th of August the animal continued
in the same state of health.
</p>
<p>
“On the 15th of August, the right guttural ganglion with a portion of
the nerve was removed; this operation was followed by the same
phenomena as the preceding, with this difference, that two days after
the animal could not swallow water, it run out at the nostrils. There
was in fact a communication between the nostrils and mouth from the
caries of the back molar tooth, the roots of which were opposite the
maxillary sinus, that had an opening into the nostril; the voice was lost.
</p>
<p>
“On the 20th of August, he was much emaciated, with the skin dry
and adherent; the cheeks, below the jaw, were constantly moistened
with sweat, which had been observed for twelve or fifteen days. The
wound of the right side remained fistulous; the skin was covered with
scurf, the sheath and scrotum, as well as the hind legs, were oedematous;
the animal died. Nothing remarkable was discovered on dissection.
Below the sub-occipital foramen the great sympathetic was slightly
swelled, in the form of a knot, in the place where the division had been
made.”
</p>
<p>
“<em>2d Experiment.</em> On the 26th of April, the right guttural ganglion,
with a portion of the nerve, was removed from a sound horse, four and
a half years old, strong and in good condition. The ganglion of the
left side was first a little mutilated, and the nerve was removed posteriorly
to the extent of thirty three centimetres. The animal did not
manifest so much pain as might have been expected.
</p>
<p>
“The conjunctiva soon became red and the eyelids partly covered
the eyes; the respiration became painful and loud; the pulse was hard,
strong and frequent. The animal refused all food, and drank with
great difficulty.
</p>
<p>
“This state continued till the 10th of May following. The two
wounds were almost healed; the animal eat and drank well; but the
hind legs and scrotum were still so much swollen as to interfere with
his walking; the conjunctiva remained red and the pupil contracted.
</p>
<p>
“Towards the 13th of May the skin became adherent and covered
with scurf; the cutaneous respiration was nearly destroyed.
</p>
<p>
“On the 25th of May, the swelling of the legs and the scrotum
became considerable, notwithstanding the frictions with water and
turpentine, which were made several times a day since the 13th; he
could, with difficulty be got out of the stable to be examined. The
pulse retained its hardness and frequency. The dung was hard, black
and small.
</p>
<p>
“During the month of June the phenomena were similar to those we
have enumerated; the swelling of the scrotum and the legs resisted the
tonic and stimulating applications.
</p>
<p>
“On examining the body, the ends of the nerves that had been drawn
out were found swollen as in the first horse. Similar results have been
obtained in all the other experiments that have been made on this
subject. It may be said in conclusion, that the phenomena which
appear after the removal of this ganglion, and which do not depend on
the operation, are the contraction of the pupil, the redness of the
conjunctiva, general emaciation, accompanied with swelling of the legs,
and a scurfy eruption which ultimately affects the whole cutaneous
surface.”</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_115_115" id="Footnote_115_115"></a><a href="#FNanchor_115_115"><span class="label">[115]</span></a> Galvanic experiments have at different times been made on the
bodies of those who have been executed. Vassali, Julio and Rossi
made a great number of them at Turin; but the piles that were then
used were very weak compared with those that are now employed. In
the experiments made at Newgate on the body of a criminal, the limbs
were violently agitated, the eyes opened and shut, the mouth and the
jaws moved in every direction, and the face was thrown into the most
frightful convulsions. The last and most complete experiments, that
we know of, were made at Glasgow in November 1818 by Dr. Andrew
Ure. He used for these experiments a battery composed of two hundred
and seventy pair of plates four inches square, with communicating wires,
and so arranged that they could be insulated for the purpose of applying
the electricity in a more convenient manner.
</p>
<p>
The subject, on whom these experiments were made, was of middle
height, about thirty years of age and of an athletic constitution. He
was on the gallows almost an hour, and he was not convulsed after
being hung, whilst a robber executed at the same time was violently
agitated for a considerable time. He was carried to the anatomical
theatre of the university, about ten minutes after he was removed from
the gallows. His face had a perfectly natural appearance being neither
livid nor swollen, and the neck was not dislocated.
</p>
<p>
About five minutes before the arrival of the police officers with the
body, the battery was charged with diluted nitro-sulphuric acid, which
quickly put it in a state to exert an intense action.
</p>
<p>
<em>1st Experiment.</em> A large incision was made immediately below the
occiput. The posterior half of the first vertebra was then removed and
the spinal marrow laid bare, at the same time a considerable incision
was made in the great glutæus muscle, in order to expose the sciatic
nerve. A slight incision was made in the heel; no blood escaped from
any part. A wire which communicated with one extremity of the
battery was put in contact with the spinal marrow, whilst the other was
applied to the sciatic nerve. All the muscles of the body were in an
instant agitated with convulsive motions which resembled a violent
shuddering. The strongest convulsions were on the left side; at each
time of renewing the electric contact by moving the second wire from
the haunch to the heel the knee being previously bent, the leg was
thrown out with so much force, that it threw down one of the assistants
who in vain endeavoured to prevent the extension.
</p>
<p>
<em>2d Experiment.</em> The left phrenic nerve was laid bare towards the
external edge of the sterno-thyroideus muscle, three or four inches above
the clavicle; as this nerve goes to the diaphragm, and as it communicates
with the heart by the eighth pair, it was expected, that by throwing
the galvanic fluid through it, the action of respiration would be
renewed. In consequence a small incision having been made under
the cartilage of the seventh rib, the point of an insulated wire was
placed in contact with the diaphragm, whilst the other was applied to
the phrenic nerve of the neck. This muscle, the principal agent of
respiration, contracted immediately, but with less force than was
expected. As I knew by numerous experiments that we could produce
the most powerful effects from the galvanic fluid, by leaving the extreme
communicating wires perfectly in contact with the parts on which we
wished to operate, whilst, in order to complete the electric chain,
we carried the end of the wires the length of the plates, into the last
trough of one of the poles and immediately plunged the other wire into
the last cell of the opposite side, I had recourse to this measure without
loss of time. The success was truly astonishing; instantly commenced
a strong and laborious respiration. The chest rose and fell; the
abdomen was pushed forward and then flattened, and the diaphragm
contracted and relaxed. All these motions appeared without interruption
as long as I continued the electric excitement.
</p>
<p>
In the opinion of many scientific persons who were witnesses of this
scene, this experiment was perhaps the most striking that had ever
been made with an electrical apparatus. It should be recollected that
during half an hour at least, before this, the body had been nearly
exhausted of blood and the spinal marrow had been much lacerated.
</p>
<p>
No pulsation could be perceived either in the heart or at the wrist.
</p>
<p>
<em>3d Experiment.</em> The suborbitar nerve was laid bare at its exit from
the suborbitar foramen. One of the conducting wires was applied to
the nerve and the other to the heel; the most extraordinary grimaces
were produced. All the muscles were put simultaneously in action in
a frightful manner; rage, horrour, despair, anguish and frightful smiles
united their hideous expression in the face of the assassin. At the
sight of this, many of the spectators were obliged to leave the room
and one of them fainted.
</p>
<p>
<em>4th Experiment.</em> The last galvanic experiment was made by transmitting
the electric fluid from the spinal marrow to the cubital nerve near
the elbow; the fingers moved quickly like those of a performer on a
violin; one of the assistants who endeavoured to keep the hand shut,
found that it opened in spite of his efforts. A wire was applied to a slight
incision made at the end of the first finger; the hand had been previously
shut; the finger was instantly extended, and, after a convulsive agitation
of the arm, the dead man seemed to point his finger at the spectators,
some of whom thought that he had come to life.
</p>
<p>
An hour was consumed in these experiments.</p></div>

<div class="footnote">

<p><a name="Footnote_116_116" id="Footnote_116_116"></a><a href="#FNanchor_116_116"><span class="label">[116]</span></a> It is shewn by the beautiful experiments of M. Legallois, that the
heart derives the principle of its forces from the spinal marrow, and
from the whole spinal marrow, since the destruction of one of its three
portions can arrest completely the circulation. The destruction of the
spinal marrow does not entirely annihilate the motions of the heart;
but it weakens them sufficiently to prevent the circulation, and this
weakening is so much the greater, as the portion of spinal marrow
destroyed is larger. It may be presumed from this, that notwithstanding
the weakening which follows the removal of a part of this marrow,
the circulation may still continue if we lessen the sum of the forces
which the heart must expend to maintain it. For this it is only necessary
to diminish by ligatures on the arteries, the extent of the circle to
which the heart distributes the blood. This conjecture is confirmed by
experiment. It has been seen, for example, that the destruction of the
marrow which is very suddenly fatal in full grown rabbits, ceases to be
so, if before doing it the abdominal aorta is tied between the coeliac
and the superior mesentric arteries. The application of the same
principle to other parts of the body leads to a still more surprising result,
it is this, that in order to support life in rabbits of a certain age, after
having destroyed the cervical marrow, it is necessary first to cut off the
head. They will be completely dead if the marrow be destroyed before
they are decapitated; this arises from the fact, that by cutting off the
head all this part is taken out of the domain of the circulation, and
that by it the heart having need of less force to continue its function,
we can weaken it by the destruction of the cervical marrow without
its ceasing to perform it.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_117_117" id="Footnote_117_117"></a><a href="#FNanchor_117_117"><span class="label">[117]</span></a> When an animal is thus struck, it is not certain that the concussion
has not extended its effects upon a greater or less part of the spinal
marrow; and it is not known consequently if the motions of the heart
would not cease, even when asphyxia might be prevented by means of
artificial respiration.</p></div></div>


<h3><a name="P2_CHAPTER_XII" id="P2_CHAPTER_XII"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER XII.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="fs50">OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE DEATH OF THE BRAIN OVER
THAT OF ALL THE ORGANS.</span></h3>


<p>When the brain dies, the animal life dies, for the
functions of this life, either directly or indirectly, have
their seat in the brain. It is manifest, that all the operations
and affections of the mind, together with sensation,
locomotion, and the voice, must be put an end to in such
case. The difficulty then respects the functions of the
organic life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_319" id="Page_319">[319]</a></span></p>


<h4>I. <em>Is the interruption of the functions of the organic
life a direct consequence of the cessation of the
cerebral actions?</em></h4>

<p>We shall here adduce both observation and experiment
to prove, that the internal functions are all of them, as well
as the action of the heart, withdrawn from the immediate
influence of the brain.</p>

<p>1st, There are a number of diseases affecting the brain,
which occasion so general a suspension of the animal life,
as to leave neither sensation nor voluntary motion, excepting
some feeble oscillations of the intercostals and the
diaphragm. In this state the individual has lost the half
of his existence, but the one half composed of the organic
functions, continues in the meanwhile to subsist, and in
many cases with energy. This phenomenon is exemplified
continually in apoplexy, in concussion of the brain,
and extravasation of blood upon its surface.</p>

<p>2dly, During sleep the secretions certainly go on,
though Bordeu insists upon the contrary opinion, with
the view of proving the influence of the nerves over the
glands. During a state of sleep, digestion goes on as
usually it does. The exhalations of the body are made
with perfect freedom, and often augmented beyond their
natural quantity; the process of nutrition continues to
be effected, and is probably under such circumstances,
increased. There are many proofs in favor of this opinion;
but a state of sleep is a state of collapse in the brain.
Then, neither is the relaxation of the functions of the
internal organs the consequence of a relaxation of action
in the brain, nor the death of the former the immediate
effect of the death of the latter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_320" id="Page_320">[320]</a></span></p>

<p>3dly, The sleep of animals, which pass a certain part
of the year in a state of torpor, is a very strong proof of
the co-existence of a suspension of the cerebral functions,
with a permanent action of those of the organic life.<a name="FNanchor_118_118" id="FNanchor_118_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a></p>

<p>4thly, In the different palsies; in those for instance
which affect the lower limbs, and the viscera of the pelvis,
in consequence of some concussion or compression of the
medulla spinalis, the communication of the paralyzed
parts with the brain, is either entirely cut off, or only
enfeebled. It is entirely interrupted when all feeling and
power of moving have ceased&mdash;it is enfeebled, when the
one and the other of these properties are only enfeebled.
But in these two cases the general and the capillary circulations
continue. The exhalations from the cutaneous
surface and in the cellular substance, are made as usual;
the process of absorption goes on, for without absorption,
we should soon see dropsy. The secretions also are
effected, for nothing in such sort of palsy is more common
than a copious secretion of mucus from the bladder. As
for nutrition if it be diminished in energy, the process is
certainly never entirely arrested.</p>

<p>5thly, Spasms and convulsions, which proceed from an
unnatural energy of the cerebral action, have little influence
over the exhalation, secretion, and nutrition of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_321" id="Page_321">[321]</a></span>
parts in which they make their appearance. The trouble
and excessive agitation of the animal life of such parts,
compared with the calm of their organic life, are facts
well worthy of remark.</p>

<p>6thly, Fœtuses without heads, in the uterus, possess as
active an organic life, as those which have no defect of conformation
whatever, and sometimes at the time of birth,
are monstrous even in bulk; this circumstance I have
frequently had occasion to observe at my amphitheatre;
the functions of nutrition then and circulation may take
place with activity, though deprived of the influence of
the brain:</p>

<p>7thly, In animals, which have no cerebral mass, and in
those (the polypes for instance) where not even a nervous
system is apparent, these organic processes are admirably
well conducted,<a name="FNanchor_119_119" id="FNanchor_119_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> the greater part of them indeed are
common to the vegetable, and the animal.</p>

<p>8thly, If the different proofs, which Bordeu has given
of the influence of the brain over the functions be well
examined, it will seem that no one of them is decisive.
The sudden interruption of the secreted fluid, in consequence
of the division of the nerves of the part, would
be the only proof which I should be inclined to admit as
positive. Now I am not acquainted with any means of
making such division with exactness. We have heard
much of an experiment of this nature upon the parotids;
but the disposition of the nerves distributed to these
glands is such, that I have not been even tempted to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_322" id="Page_322">[322]</a></span>
repeat the experiment. The testicle is better adapted for
the attempt, and accordingly without touching the vessels,
I divided the spermatic nerves, but an inflammation and a
deposit of matter took place in the gland, and with respect
to the secretion of the semen, I could not judge of the
effect of the division of the nerves. But here this very
inflammation coming on without the influence of the
brain, appears to me to infer a possibility of the seminal
secretion under the same circumstances. In this experiment,
the spermatic artery cannot be separated from the
plexus which it receives from the great sympathetic, so
intricate is the network of these nerves about it; their
division however is of little consequence, as they come
from the ganglions. It is easy to break off all communication
with the brain, by destroying the lumbar fillets of
nerves.</p>

<p>I might add a number of other considerations to the
above, but here I have to remark that the distinction of
the sensibility and contractility into their two kinds is
particularly worth attention. In fact, the idea of sensibility
in our usual way of seeing things, suggests the idea
of the nerves, the nerves again make us think upon the
brain, we associate the three ideas, but excepting for
the animal life they should not be associated. In the
organic life, at least their union is not immediate.</p>

<p>I do not mean to say that the cerebral nerves have no
influence whatever over the organic sensibility, but I
maintain that such influence is not direct and not of the
nature of that which is observed in the animal sensibility.</p>

<p>Many authors have already discovered a number of
difficulties resulting from the opinion which makes the
nerves the exclusive seat of sensibility, they have even
sought for other means of explaining the phenomena of
great living bodies. But of its agents we know as little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_323" id="Page_323">[323]</a></span>
as we do of its nature, and have no means of elucidating
questions of this sort. Let us be contented with analyzing,
collecting and comparing facts with seizing their
general results; the aggregate of these researches will
compose the true theory of the vital powers; the rest is
only conjecture: but besides the considerations which I
have offered, there is another which manifestly goes to
prove that the organic functions are not under the immediate
influence of the brain, and this is, that the viscera,
which perform such functions do not receive their nerves
from the brain but from the ganglions.</p>

<p>This anatomical fact is observable in the liver, the
kidney, the spleen, pancreas, intestines, &amp;c. even in the
organs of the animal life there are nerves which serve
for the external, and nerves which serve for the internal
functions. In such the former come directly from the
brain, the latter from the ganglions. Thus the ciliary
nerves, which come off from the opthalmic ganglion, are
those which preside over the secretions and nutrition of
the eyes, the optic nerve which is derived from the brain
is the nerve of vision.<a name="FNanchor_120_120" id="FNanchor_120_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> In the same way the olfactory
nerves of the pituitary membrane are the agents by which
we have the perception of odours, the threads which come
off from the ganglions of Mekel, relate only to the organic
phenomena of the membranes.</p>

<p>Now the nerves of the ganglions cannot transmit the
action of the brain; for we have seen that the nervous
system derived from these bodies should be considered as
entirely independent of the nervous system of the brain;
and that the great sympathetic does not derive its origin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[324]</a></span>
from the brain, from the spinal marrow, or from the
nerves of the animal life; but from the ganglions exclusively;
this nerve indeed does not exist, it is only the
aggregate of so many small nervous systems as there are
ganglions, which are the particular centres of the organic
life, just in the same way as the brain is the great and
only centre of the animal life.</p>

<p>To establish it as a fact that the great sympathetic such
as it is understood does not in reality exist, I might add a
number of proofs to those, which I have already mentioned.
The nervous communications, which are taken for
it, are nothing more than accessories to the system of the
ganglions; for 1st, These nervous communications, as
Cuvier has observed, are not met with in the necks of
birds; between the upper cervical and first thoracic
ganglion there is no vestige of a sympathetic. In birds
then, the upper cervical ganglion is that which in man
the opthalmic ganglion, the ganglion of Mekel and others
are. This disposition, which is natural in birds, agrees
with what I have sometimes observed in the human subject
between the first lumbar and the last thoracic ganglions,
as well as between the lumbar and sacral ganglions themselves.
2dly, In many instances there are no ganglions
in the spot where the pretended sympathetic nerve communicates
with the spinal marrow. This may be seen in
the human neck, and in the abdomen of fish, but such
disposition should be thus regarded. The inferior cervical
ganglion furnishes a great branch which ascends to
the superior cervical ganglion, and establishes between
the two a direct communication; but in ascending it distributes
many branches to each of the cervical nerves,
which form a secondary communication.</p>

<p>If we reflect on these considerations, together with
those which have been already offered, we shall be more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_325" id="Page_325">[325]</a></span>
and more convinced&mdash;1st, That the great sympathetic is
only an assemblage of small nervous systems, having each
of them a ganglion for its centre, and all of them independent
of each other, though generally communicating
with the spinal marrow and between themselves. 2dly,
That the nerves belonging to these small systems, cannot
be considered as a part of the great nervous system of
the animal life. 3dly, That the organs, which are provided
exclusively with the nerves, are not under the
immediate influence of the brain.</p>

<p>Notwithstanding which, we must not suppose that all
the organs which serve for the internal functions, receive
their nerves exclusively from the ganglions: many of
these organs are furnished from the brain, and yet from
experiment, it is found that they are not under the immediate
influence of the brain.</p>

<p>As yet we have only observation and reasoning for the
basis of the important principle which we are labouring
to establish, namely, that the organic functions are not
directly put a stop to in consequence of the death of the
brain; but experiments upon living animals are not a less
evident demonstration of this principle.</p>

<p>1st, I have always observed, that in producing palsy
or convulsion, I have never been able to impair in any
very sensible or sudden manner, either the exhalation,
the absorption, or the nutrition of the convulsed or palsied
part.</p>

<p>2dly, It has been for a long time known, that no spasm
of the muscular fibres of the stomach, bladder, or intestines,
can be produced by irritating the nerves of the
ganglions which go to these organs.</p>

<p>3dly, The division of the nerves of the ganglions,
will not immediately paralyze the hollow organs. Their
vermicular motions continue for a long time after the
experiment.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_326" id="Page_326">[326]</a></span></p>

<p>4thly, With respect to the stomach, intestines, bladder
and uterus, I have repeated the galvanic experiments
which, with respect to the heart, have already been mentioned
at length; but never could obtain contractions.<a name="FNanchor_121_121" id="FNanchor_121_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>5thly, The same experiments being made upon the
organic muscles, and the great sympathetic nerve of a
dog, there was no contraction.</p>

<p>6thly, The issue of the latter operation may be easily
conceived, according to our manner of regarding things.
In fact, the ganglions, which are situated between the
gastric organs and the nervous trunk of the chest, might
possibly have interrupted the series of the galvanic phenomena.
With a view, then, to remove all doubt of this
kind, I exposed the nerves, which go from the ganglions
immediately to the stomach, bladder and rectum, and in
this way galvanised the organs but no contraction appeared
to me to be the result of the experiment; at least no
contraction, which I could suppose to be the effect of
galvanism, for here I cannot too much recommend a
proper distinction to be made between that which should
be the effect of this fluid, and that which results from the
mechanical contact of the metals.</p>

<p>7thly, These experiments are not easily made upon the
intestines, on account of the tenuity of their nerves; but
as these nerves compose a very perceptible plexus about
the mesenteric artery, the intestine may be galvanized by
surrounding the artery with one of the metals, while the
other is placed under the intestinal tube. This experiment
I have made, but could not obtain any sensible
result.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_327" id="Page_327">[327]</a></span></p>

<p>8thly, The preceding essays were made upon warm
and red-blooded animals. Similar attempts were repeated
on cold and red-blooded animals, but with no effect.</p>

<p>9thly, The nerves which immediately supply the gastric
organs of the frog, are so delicate as to make it an
extremely difficult matter to get them into proper contact
with the zinc: a small contraction of the stomach was,
however, obtained by Jadelot on operating directly on
these nerves; but this contraction was similar, no doubt,
to those which I have so frequently observed in other
experiments, and not to be compared to the astonishing
effects which are observable in the voluntary muscles. I
shall conclude, therefore, that with respect to the galvanic
phenomena, there exists a wide difference between the
muscles of the animal life and those of the organic life.</p>

<p>I have now collected proof enough, I trust, for resolving,
with certainty, the question proposed in the above
chapter, and for establishing it as a fundamental principle.&mdash;1st,
That the brain does not directly influence the
organs and the functions of the internal life; and 2dly,
That, therefore, the interruption of these functions, in
case of any great lesion of the brain, is not an immediate
effect of such lesion.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, I am far from considering the cerebral
action as foreign entirely to the organic life. I only
maintain that its influence upon it is indirect, and as yet
but little known. I have been somewhat prolix upon
this subject; for certainly nothing in medicine is more
vague than the sense which is commonly attached to the
words <em>nervous action</em>, <em>cerebral action</em>, &amp;c. There is
never a proper distinction made between that which
belongs to one life, and that which is the attribute of the
other. Cullen, in particular, may be reproached with
having exaggerated the influence of the brain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_328" id="Page_328">[328]</a></span></p>


<h4>II. <em>Is the interruption of the functions of the organic
life, the indirect effect of the cessation of the cerebral
action?</em></h4>

<p>The organic life continues to subsist for a certain time,
after the apparent death of the individual. There must
be some intermediate agents then, the cessation of the
action of which, occasions the death of the inward organs.
Such agents are chiefly the mechanical organs of respiration.
The series of the phenomena are the following:</p>

<p>1st, The cerebral actions are interrupted.&mdash;2dly, The
mechanical functions of the lungs are put an end to.&mdash;3dly,
There is an annihilation of their chemical functions.&mdash;4thly,
The black blood circulates in all the parts.&mdash;5thly,
The movement of the heart and the action of all
the parts is weakened.&mdash;6thly, Suspended.</p>

<p>All the inward organs then, die nearly as they do in
asphyxia; that is to say&mdash;1st, Because they are penetrated
by the black blood.&mdash;2dly, Because the circulation ceases
to communicate that motion which is essential to their
life.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, there are many differences between death
from asphyxia, and death from lesion of the brain. 1st,
The animal life in the latter sort of death, is generally
interrupted at the very instant of the shock or blow. In
the former it is terminated only in proportion as the black
blood penetrates the substance of the brain.&mdash;2dly, In
the greater number of the asphyxiæ, the circulation does
not immediately cease, the blood is only gradually blackened,
and continues for some time to be moved onwards
by the agitation of such parts as are still under the
influence of the brain. On the contrary, in lesion of the
brain, the interruption of respiration is sudden; the blood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_329" id="Page_329">[329]</a></span>
also loses its red colour at once: on the other hand, the
animal life being suddenly arrested, the organs of volition
become immovable on the spot, and are capable no longer
of favouring the motion of the blood. This remark is
particularly applicable to the breast, the parietes of which
facilitate very much the pulmonary circulation, and even
the movements of the heart by their rise and fall, for
in such alternation of motion consists the true influence
which the circulation receives from the respiratory process.</p>

<p>But after all, these two sorts of death may be more or
less similar to each other according to the way in which
they happen. The differences which I have pointed out
are by no means general. Thus, when asphyxia is sudden,
as when for instance the air of the lungs is pumped
out with a syringe, there are neither livid spots, or fulness
of the lungs to be met with. The circulation ceases
quickly, and the phenomena of death are such as are
observable when the brain is suddenly destroyed.</p>

<p>On the contrary, if the death of the brain be slow, and
the process of respiration for a certain time continued,
the capillary system of the lungs will be gorged with
blood, and the general capillary system be filled also. The
circulation in such case will be slow to cease, and the
phenomena of death like those of many of the asphyxiæ.
Thus the promptitude or slowness of death, proceeding
from lesion of the brain, will occasion all the differences.</p>

<p>It has been often a question in what way criminals
die, who are hanged. In some, the vertebral column is
luxated, and in others, want of respiration is the cause
of death.<a name="FNanchor_122_122" id="FNanchor_122_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> But whenever there is luxation, there is at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_330" id="Page_330">[330]</a></span>
the same time asphyxia, and in such case asphyxia is produced,
both because the pressure of the cord intercepts
the passage of the air, and because the intercostals and
diaphragm are paralyzed.</p>

<p>From what I have now said, a comparison may be
made between the three kinds of death upon which I
have expatiated. This comparison, according to my
ideas, is of importance: I shall give some features of it.
Generally speaking, there is a greater similarity in the
two modes by which the death of the brain, or that of
the lungs produces the death of the organs, than between
either of these modes, and that, where the death of the
heart is followed by the same effect.</p>

<p>But 1st, There is always black blood in the red-blooded
system, when death begins either by the brain or the lungs.
When the functions of the heart are suddenly suspended,
the arterial system contains a portion of red blood only.</p>

<p>2dly, In the two first cases, the circulation continues
for awhile; in the third, it is immediately suppressed.</p>

<p>3dly, When the death of the organs is a consequence
of the death of the heart, they die, because they cease to
receive that excitement, to which they are accustomed
from the motion of the blood. When their death is produced
by that of the brain or lungs, they die not only
because they lose the excitement above-mentioned, but
because they are penetrated by a fluid which is incapable
of keeping up their actions, &amp;c. The reader will easily
finish the parallel which I have thus begun.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_331" id="Page_331">[331]</a></span></p>

<p>In red and cold-blooded animals, the death of the
organs succeeds much more slowly to that of the brain,
than in red and warm-blooded animals. We cannot assign
the reason of this fact, because we do not know the difference
of the arterial blood from the venous blood of these
animals, nor the effect which is produced on their organs
by the contact of either sort of blood with them.</p>

<p>When reptiles remain for a length of time under water,
does the arterial blood become black from want of respiration?
is the influx of such blood into their organs,
pernicious or not?<a name="FNanchor_123_123" id="FNanchor_123_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> or is there a sufficient quantity of
air contained in the large vesicles of the lungs of these
animals to oxydate their blood for a length of time, as
but little blood is capable of passing into the pulmonary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[332]</a></span>
artery, which is only a branch of the aorta. The latter
opinion appears to be confirmed by the experiment of
injecting the lungs of a dog with a large quantity of
air, in which case the blood of the creature is reddened
for a greater length of time. But all these questions,
notwithstanding the essays of Goodwyn, require much
elucidation.</p>

remarked, for example, that those who were hung at Lyons died quicker
than those who were hung at Paris. In seeking for the cause of this
difference, it was ascertained that in those who were executed at Lyons
there was almost always a luxation of the first or the second vertebra,
which was owing to a rotatory motion, which the executioner gave to
the criminal in throwing him from the scaffold. The death was quick,
because it was produced by compression or laceration of the spinal marrow;
it was slower in the other case in which it was only the result of
asphyxia.</p></div>

<p><a name="Footnote_123_123" id="Footnote_123_123"></a><a href="#FNanchor_123_123"><span class="label">[123]</span></a> It appears by the beautiful experiments of M. Edwards that frogs
can live but a very short time in water deprived of air by boiling.
Immersed in a small body of water containing air they soon die, no
doubt after they have exhausted the air held in solution in the water.
They can on the contrary live an indefinite time in this state of immersion,
if care be taken to renew the water sufficiently often. The same
thing happens, and still more certainly, if they are immersed in running
water.
</p>
<p>
It is not by passing the water through the lungs, as the fish does
through the branchiæ, that the frog obtains the air held in solution by
the water in which he is immersed, the skin is in this case the sole
respiratory organ. M. Edwards is satisfied that this mode of respiration
is not sufficient to support life, except between certain limits of temperature;
a frog immersed in a volume of water which is not changed,
continues to live so much the longer as the temperature of this fluid
approaches nearer 32°. At this degree frogs are not torpid, as might
be supposed, only their motions are slower.
</p>
<p>
As long as the animal immersed in the water remains perfectly alive,
which may be known by the vivacity of his motions, it is certain that
the respiratory phenomena continue to be performed by him; we see
in fact on the membranes in the interstices of the toes, the vessels
filled with vermilion blood. When the black colour begins to appear,
the animal soon becomes immoveable and insensible.</p></div></div>


<h3><a name="P2_CHAPTER_XIII" id="P2_CHAPTER_XIII"></a><a href="#CONTENTS">CHAPTER XIII.</a><br />
<br />
<span class="fs50">OF THE INFLUENCE OF THE DEATH OF THE BRAIN OVER
THAT OF THE BODY IN GENERAL.</span></h3>


<p>From the consideration of what has been said in the
preceding chapter, nothing can be more easy than to form
an accurate idea of the manner in which the phenomena
of general death, commencing by the brain, are concatenated.
The series is as follows:</p>

<p>1st, The cerebral action is annihilated. 2dly, There
is a sudden cessation of sensation and voluntary motion.
3dly, A simultaneous paralysis of the intercostals and
diaphragm. 4thly, An interruption of the mechanical
phenomena of respiration and the voice. 5thly, An
annihilation of the chemical phenomena of the lungs.
6thly, A passage of black blood into the arteries. 7thly,
A slowness of circulation owing to the influx of such
blood into the arteries, and the absolute immobility of all
the parts, of the intercostals and diaphragm in particular.
8thly, The heart dies and the general circulation ceases.
9thly, The organic life vanishes. 10thly, The animal
heat, which is the product of all the functions, disappears,
11thly, The white organs die.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[333]</a></span></p>

<p>Though in this kind of death, as well as in the two
preceding kinds, the functions are suddenly annihilated;
the parts retain, for a certain time, a number of the
properties of life. The organic sensibility and contractility,
continue for some time, to be manifest in the
muscles of the two lives; and in those of the animal life,
the susceptibility of being affected by the galvanic fluid
is very great in the muscles of the animal life.</p>

<p>This permanence of the organic properties, is nearly
the same in every case; the only cause which affects it,
is the slowness with which the phenomena of death have
succeeded each other. In every case where their duration
has been the same, whatever may have been the cause of
death, experiments instituted upon these properties, are
attended with similar results; for it is evident that concussion
of the brain, luxation of the vertebræ, the section
of the spinal marrow, apoplexy, compression of the brain,
or inflammation, are all of them causes which are attended
with a like effect.</p>

<p>The same, however, is not the case with respect to the
asphyxiæ produced by the different gases. We have
shown the reason of this in the more or less deleterious
nature of the gases which produce asphyxiæ.</p>

<p>The state of the lungs also, is very various in the bodies
of persons who have died from lesions of the brain.
This organ is sometimes gorged and sometimes almost
empty: it shews, however, whether the death of the
individual has been sudden or gradual. The same indication
may be had from the state of the exterior surfaces.</p>

<p>The death, which is the consequence of disease, commences
much more rarely in the brain, than in the lungs.
Nevertheless, in certain paroxysms of acute fever, the
blood is violently carried to the head, and is the occasion<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_334" id="Page_334">[334]</a></span>
of death. The concatenation of its phenomena, are then
the same as take place in sudden death.</p>

<p>There are a great number of other cases besides those
of fever, where the commencement of death may be in
the brain, though the brain itself may not have been
previously affected by the disease. In these cases, the
state of the lungs is very various; but little can be learnt
from it with respect to the nature of the disease. It is
only an indication of the manner in which the functions
have been terminated.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
